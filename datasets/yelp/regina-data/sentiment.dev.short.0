ok never going back to this place again .
easter day nothing open , heard about this place figured it would ok .
the host that walked us to the table and left without a word .
it just gets worse .
the food tasted awful .
no sign of the manager .
the last couple years this place has been going down hill .
last night however it was way to thick and tasteless .
it smelled like rotten urine .
i am not exaggerating .
this smelled bad !
it was obvious it was the same damn one he brought the first time .
i tried to eat it but it was disgusting .
it tasted horrible !
i pushed it aside and did n't eat anymore .
i will never be back .
do yourself a favor and just stay away .
i ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda .
$ _num_ for a soda ?
the total for this lunch was $ _num_ .
it 's not really french food and the decor is n't really french either .
waitress ( jen ) was nice but we waited very long for the food .
really stressed to leave them off the plate .
short term memory apparently since they were still on main entree .
steak cooked wrong , under temp .
if we were to get this server again , i 'd ask to move .
we waited over half an hour to get menus and then only got _num_ .
about _num_ minutes after sitting down , our orders were taken .
not so !
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
drive out , pay , grab food and leave .
no everytime my food still needs to get ready .
they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
i will not recommend them to any of my friends .
no , no .
not to sound like a broken record ... but everyone here is right .
i would honestly give this place zero stars if i could .
my girlfriend said , `` we 'd like to sit outside . ''
`` oh , my bad .
we walked out .
so , ended up going to a place called scramble .
so rude .
it wasnt busy so i dont get why they had any dirty tables !
at that point , we were irritated and just got up and left .
ten minutes later , another couple was seated at the next table .
i told him that salmon does not take this long to grill .
for all those reasons , we wo n't go back .
the waiter must have said `` i 'm sorry '' literally _num_ times .
it was getting annoying , actually .
it sucks , big time .
no outside beverages allowed . ''
major points lost there .
you ca n't truly ever redeem yourself after that .
for _num_ drinks it was over $ _num_ .
_num_ seconds later they start telling him they 'll get more from the back .
the only slightly redeeming qualities about this place is the juke box & restroom .
i remember the restroom being clean .
all in all this place was a failure .
i will never go back to metro now that there is another option .
service is horrible .
even with the great beer price , i will not go back .
also the cash only bar was a terrible surprise .
i am thoroughly disappointed .
i would n't waste my time .
