ok never going back to this place again .
easter day nothing open , heard about this place figured it would ok .
the host that walked us to the table and left without a word .
it just gets worse .
the food tasted awful .
no sign of the manager .
the last couple years this place has been going down hill .
last night however it was way to thick and tasteless .
it smelled like rotten urine .
i am not exaggerating .
this smelled bad !
it was obvious it was the same damn one he brought the first time .
i tried to eat it but it was disgusting .
it tasted horrible !
i pushed it aside and did n't eat anymore .
i will never be back .
do yourself a favor and just stay away .
i ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda .
$ _num_ for a soda ?
the total for this lunch was $ _num_ .
it 's not really french food and the decor is n't really french either .
waitress ( jen ) was nice but we waited very long for the food .
really stressed to leave them off the plate .
short term memory apparently since they were still on main entree .
steak cooked wrong , under temp .
if we were to get this server again , i 'd ask to move .
we waited over half an hour to get menus and then only got _num_ .
about _num_ minutes after sitting down , our orders were taken .
not so !
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
drive out , pay , grab food and leave .
no everytime my food still needs to get ready .
they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
i will not recommend them to any of my friends .
no , no .
not to sound like a broken record ... but everyone here is right .
i would honestly give this place zero stars if i could .
my girlfriend said , `` we 'd like to sit outside . ''
`` oh , my bad .
we walked out .
so , ended up going to a place called scramble .
so rude .
it wasnt busy so i dont get why they had any dirty tables !
at that point , we were irritated and just got up and left .
ten minutes later , another couple was seated at the next table .
i told him that salmon does not take this long to grill .
for all those reasons , we wo n't go back .
the waiter must have said `` i 'm sorry '' literally _num_ times .
it was getting annoying , actually .
it sucks , big time .
no outside beverages allowed . ''
major points lost there .
you ca n't truly ever redeem yourself after that .
for _num_ drinks it was over $ _num_ .
_num_ seconds later they start telling him they 'll get more from the back .
the only slightly redeeming qualities about this place is the juke box & restroom .
i remember the restroom being clean .
all in all this place was a failure .
i will never go back to metro now that there is another option .
service is horrible .
even with the great beer price , i will not go back .
also the cash only bar was a terrible surprise .
i am thoroughly disappointed .
i would n't waste my time .
the service sucks , management is terrible .
i suggest you do n't even waste your time .
this place is large enough for everything .
too bad it seems like the place is not cared for .
took forever to be served and the place was dead .
waitress tends to hang out at the bar versus wait on the tables .
the only full service car wash near my house .
little slow but there was great attention to detail .
i got my car back and was extremely unhappy .
the side mirrors , rear view mirror were not washed and dried .
only one reason for the second star and that was the considerate employees !
they are ok for cleaning the outside , but they rushed the interior detail .
the owner was incredibly rude to me .
horrible .
unfortunately someone stole the change from my coin slot .
i was in on february _num_ , _num_ .
was told they could detail my suv for _num_ .
paid then they told me they do n't have enough people for their detail .
there goes my $ _num_ .
bad management .
they will not tell the owner nor let me tell the owners name .
i guess she was getting off work .
very disappointed !
my experience with this hall was terrible !
_num_ ) the building is infested with roaches !
_num_ ) check the mens restroom !
_num_ ) do not hire her bartenders or wait staff !
they are completely unprofessional and have no experience .
she did clean the mess but with the biggest attitude ever .
she will not return any calls or emails .
she is a nightmare to deal with .
this banquet hall does n't refund any money for any reason .
there is spray paint on the outside and the floors are very gross .
the staff is disrespectful and unprofessional .
the price is way to high for such low quality .
really horrible apartment complex .
badly infested with roaches and crime in unbelievably high .
the individuals in the office do not care about tenants at all .
they claimed that they lost their copy of my apartment key .
seriously , u 've been warned ... run !
literally !
no lights @ night !
terrible !
i would n't recommend this apartments to anyone !
lived here from july _num_ - july _num_ .
management were slow on their end when you need help with anything .
neighbors are dirty and have no courtesy to your living !
its gross to look at .
piss me off and i talked to their parents .
false advertisement .
this is not the first time we have been kept waiting either .
not much selection here and a lot of dried food items .
disappointed to say the least .
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
i stopped him to ask questions and he was condescending and impatient .
it certainly was n't for patient care or respect .
it started out well though .
this total cost for a new system was going to be about $ _num_ .
so i would suggest not taking your car here for any service .
i ended up paying $ _num_ for job .
i would not recommend this business as i feel they are very dishonest .
so i was very thankful !
long story short , do n't go to brakes plus .
they over charge .
their prices are not cheap and their service sucks .
my experience was horrible .
their employees do n't even know how to do their job .
when i arrived i was hoping i was in the wrong place .
the office was old , run down and not very clean .
friday rolls around and i have received no phone call .
i left a voicemail , no call back .
called again on monday and they still have no results .
extremely unimpressed and would not recommend them .
only gave two stars for the ease of scheduling .
their billing staff is useless and constantly getting the billing codes mixed up .
avoid this doctor unless you enjoy over paying for bad customer service .
i 'm not sure why she said that to me .
i am concerned about something , needed help and was treated this way .
they are n't very good at keeping the client informed on their case .
a disappointing electronics store for its size .
then they acted like they could have cared less about helping me .
sorry to say , they lost me as a customer .
neither is customer service .
in addition to this , the price was marked wrong on the shelf .
the store feels like you 're going into a dirty walmart .
if someone 's helpful , it 's because they 're getting commission .
it was so not appropriate and scared every little child that walked in .
we quickly walked past it to the computer area .
we enter the laptop area and walked past five employees .
no one said a word to us even though they made eye contact .
we completely wasted an hour of our time and left .
they were very helpful and offered to match any price from fry 's .
huge waste of time !
looked online for a laptop and checked availability .
they completely ignore you and walk right by you .
_num_ out of _num_ of there employees actually knows something .
customer service sucks .
horrible !
indoors looked brighter and more welcoming , as well .
`` $ _num_ to $ _num_ '' .
( okay not confident in your product knowledge ) .
then he sold me a $ _num_ unit with european maps .
speak with a supervisor , they return my first gps .
this is a pretty short review as i have minimal nice things to say .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if its in the weekly ad they probably will not have any in stock .
_num_ .
... no .
i know that your store 's prices are cheaper than almost any place locally .
it does not mean you should roll your eyes at them .
oddly enough , they do n't match their own online prices .
are you kidding me ?
that 's insulting .
our experience here was a train wreck .
for years , that did n't seem to be a problem at fry 's .
but it 's full of frustration to shop now .
do n't waste your time at this place .
what 's wrong with it , i drove this whole way .
me : hell no !
me : what the hell would that have done ?
that makes no sense whatsoever .
so there you have it , no customer service and no organization .
know your stuff before stepping into these kind of places .
the staff we talked to seemed to lack product knowledge .
i will not be back .
however my iphone sucks !
nothing too tough .
stupid queen .
no ... he works at fry 's electronics .
horrible customer service !
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
customer service is terrible .
thanks for the waist of my time , gas , and money fry 's .
they sell them for the same price , because supposedly they are tested .
just do n't expect any service if you are female .
yet there 3-4 boys standing around with nothing to do .
amazingly poor customer service .
they price match some online places , so be prepared for that .
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
$ _num_ for the entire purchase ) from frys electronics .
we also purchased a _num_ year in home service contract .
prices are just plain retail .
bought many items at fry 's electronics but never ever again .
their own techs could not get them to work !
the one at _num_ southwest this place suck .
return are limited days and bad thing of all low experiences .
bad place to go for electronics .
you ca n't reach a human being on the phone .
caused me to call and shop at target instead .
you people are worse than a used car lot .
i had no interest in looking or being there in general .
ive been to run down nasty gas stations with cleaner bathrooms than this place .
when i checked out i said i would like to price match the item .
i told him that was ridiculous and i would just buy it on amazon .
i thanked him and walked away .
fry 's , you just lost a long term customer !
wandered around electronics for _num_ minutes without anyone offering to help me .
had _num_ different employees walk by my .
one just walked by .
never even looked at me .
keep in mind , the place is not busy .
the smile was not returned .
she said she could n't leave the area .
so , he had to go get it again .
at this point , i was ready to walk out .
but , did n't want to start all over at another store .
it was clear this is the way the manager runs the store .
not after tonight .
i am not trying to get free stuff .
someone needs to know how the store is managed .
ridiculous .
this place has hundreds of sales reps on a floor & nobody knows shit !
or they put eyes down like they did n't hear you !
this place has hundreds of sales reps on a floor & nobody knows shit !
or they put eyes down like they did n't hear you !
they didnt ship it out til three days later .
will not respond to any of the multiple emails i have sent .
after _num_ minutes on hold someone answers who doesnt speak english .
he too busy to talk .
and of course no one has still returned my call .
you will get ripped off !
the reason i went in is because of the no sales tax option .
but nothing .
ill find somewhere else to spend my money i guess .
customer service is horrible , and their prices are well above internet pricing .
i will not be shopping here anymore .
that is why they get one star .
their service is awful .
none the employees seem to know anything .
i wandered around for _num_ minutes trying to find a pair of gaming glasses .
i always check every possible competitor before i am forced to shop here .
if you can , avoid like the plague .
horrible service .
next time , i 'll remember not to bother to go to fry 's .
fry 's is the electronics store everyone loves to hate .
i could not find it .
an employee could not find it , and his manager could not find it .
no firearms allowed !
no free wifi .
walked around for 30-45 minutes trying to find what i wanted .
horrible .
they said they could n't find my account .
they turned rude and said that there was nothing they could do .
what a waste of time .
i was there early in the morning - more employees than customers .
i stood there for _num_ minutes .
worst customer service ever .
so i left the laptop department and walked over to the television department .
someone actually approached me to see if they could help .
i 'm typing this as i 'm still in the store not being helped .
i should just punch myself in the junk before walking in here .
if i could leave zero stars i would .
he was the most rude , condescending person i 've ever come across .
run away from this store as fast as you can .
terrible employees , most unhelpful group of people i ever met .
i really do n't like this store .
the store is ridiculous .
if you do n't know do n't try to bs you way through it .
i ca n't sell you the display one even though it has a price .
Negative
two negative experiences in a row and yes , you lost another customer .
walked up to the service desk in the computer department .
totally ignored by both the manager and the employees .
researched and looked online at availability .
drove _num_ miles to the store .
me : `` i 'm sorry , an item went on sale today .
went to frys to get a some battery 's and charger .
after _num_ min of waiting i just left .
very bad customer service .
will not shop here again .
the staff needs to be educated on there products and customer service .
i 've tried this place several times .
huge selection - huge fail in customer service .
and do not try to return anything .
i told them several times to cut them down & they would n't .
they have bad service here !
the work was messy !
i checked my credit card today and saw a charge of $ _num_ .
this seems like a scam to me .
week after week i go into these stores and have one problem after another .
my pool is never right .
oh i 'm sorry .
i would rather have the pants and go elsewhere .
went to drop off some clothes today to find out this location has closed !
why would n't i just order through the school then and avoid those fees ?
i really wish our school would find another photographer .
first appointment i went with contacts that just did not work for me .
$ _num_ after insurance for my glasses alone .
_num_ months later i get a bill for $ _num_ .
they are seriously overpriced and painful to work with .
they will not own their mistakes .
worse customer service i have seen in a bike shop !
no call the day they were suppose to be done .
lost business !
if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
i guess they figured that they did n't need my business .
i walked out and never went back .
the owner here is always angry and never appreciated business .
walked into just see what they offered .
there were maybe _num_ dresses in size _num_ .
but the sales associate repeatedly told us the problem was our budget .
this is supposed to be a place of healing & relaxation .
worst ever !
not pleased .
the place was dirty , way crowded with crap products .
too much stuff in a small space .
worst customer service ever !
not a fan !
from my experience it is n't worth it to go back .
this is very disappointing and bad for business .
the place it self is ok but she is just terrible person .
rude .
there is no order or procedures .
when you come in there is no hello .
just a `` pickup or drop off ? ''
also they pay little to nothing for clothes .
we ended up getting $ _num_ for _num_ full garbage bags full of clothes .
unfortunately not .
when i arrived at the store , i explained what had happened .
stood at least _num_ feet away and asked me how they felt .
absolutely horrible customer service !
i told the owner forget about it , they lost a customer forever .
this last pair however began losing their sole offer about _num_ months .
for that price they should 've repaired them by replacing the sole .
not gon na buy boots here anymore .
really disappointed in their not standing behind their product .
i purchased two western shirts a week ago .
it was not worn for any length of time .
they were just plain nasty .
it was apparent they did not give a damn about customer service .
apparently they carry seconds and have no customer service .
the guy was annoyed that i even would ask .
but , after much consultation , they decided on _num_ % off .
i just walked out .
employees are lazy here .
that will be the last time i waste my time with that place .
horrible service !
we waited over _num_ hrs for our food and never came .
it 's too small and not very clean !
do not waste your time !
only _num_ other people in the room , so not busy .
after _num_ minutes we gave up , paid for our drinks and went home .
during our visit we saw _num_ plates come out of the kitchen .
that 's _num_ plate every _num_ minutes .
sort of crappy service .
the rice was way too sticky .
not sure why this place is rated so highly .
came here earlier tonight during a storm after seeing the yelp reviews .
a total of _num_ tables - very small place .
another issue , the place felt like there was no a/c .
needless to mention , we ended up leaving .
this was the second time that i 've eaten here .
unfortunately we left over 3/4 of our food in the trash .
we had egg flour soup , crab puffs and chicken with broccoli .
we ate over lunch and spent about $ _num_ .
i ca n't believe this place has almost _num_ stars .
only been here once and not going back .
the food here is not good .
either the fried rice is decent , and the meat is not .
and it was horrible .
the egg rolls were not impressive at all .
will not be going back .
i hand him my ticket and he takes out my shoes .
`` sorry it wo n't go .
if the boot still can not be located , he will ask for compensation .
if i could give no stars i would .
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
he put me on hold several times , i repeated numbers several times .
then he told me i needed to come look for my stuff .
got there and he still could n't find my stuff .
i had him check ticket number because he would n't believe me .
no darn it shoes !
no one told me anything .
i refused to pay .
i wish i had looked at these reviews before i went there .
the woman that attempted to help me was rude .
needless to say , i left and will never return .
no one said hello or greeted us in any way .
set up is weird .
if it was busy , you could certainly never play pool .
you would be hitting everyone .
nothing to see here really .
not much on tap beyond the white trash specialties .
they 're just trying to do too much .
the beer is awful .
just a shitty selection .
really effing shitty .
they were dry and had almost no sauce .
he is hung like a horse .
`` ok so why two stars nathan ? ''
the food is average at best , the service is beyond slow .
the whole restaurant/bar needs to be pressure washed .
i wo n't be going back .
nothing about it was worth the time or the money .
everyone is wearing their stupid shirts thinking the suns actually had a chance .
it is here i realized how lame and dumb people can be .
cry me a freakin river !
the food is okay , nothing special at all , but not disgusting .
it 's just weird .
she was getting pissed , and so were we .
i would not recommend this place at all .
the worst place to eat .
greasy and soggy , yuck .
the waitress never showed up and ignored our complaints about the fish .
could n't have cared less .
i wo n't be back .
oh casey jones , how you have failed me .
terrible selection , but the price point was fine .
new menu , which is ugly by the way .
i 'm going elsewhere .
say it ai n't so !
tonight was the last straw .
it 's loud and annoying .
_num_ .
_num_ .
place is sliding backwards .
the return policy here is ridiculous .
no go .
the policy states you ca n't return power equipment after _num_ days .
and the chick at the counter was completely rude and condescending .
at least then i 'd get some bang for the _num_ bucks .
we waited another 15-20 minutes and no one ever came .
when we got to the commercial sales counter the employee did remember my call .
it is extremely inconvenient .
dont bother and go to home depot across the highway on northern .
i called and they quoted me a price on tile , twice .
really poor customer service !
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
the store was n't even that busy at the time .
wo n't be going back to this location .
the store manager norm was extremely disrespectful and rude .
so i stopped turned around and insisted that i speak to a manager .
i was never biased before i certainly am now .
he did n't either , and was very clearly upset about being alone .
like this is not a priority at all .
like the money we spent there is nothing .
why do i even bother with lowes ?
i 'm heading to home depot !
none to be found till you get inside .
the employees have _num_ carts loaded with crap so customers ca n't use them .
never order the _num_ install .
the area was checked with a laser level and was good to go .
its not his fault he works for a company like this i 'm sure .
trying to get someone to help you in this place is a serious joke !
waited _num_ minutes and no one was around .
i should just go to home depot instead .
the worst place you can go to .
the employees there just pass you on to another employee .
not good customer service .
$ _num_ later we were done .
this place is a shit hole the management is nonexistent after _num_ o'clock .
even have another appointment this is the slowest bank in town .
had a problem with someone stealing my daughters social security number .
we went home and then came back i think _num_ days later .
the manager come over and was horrible .
so much drama and disrespect over something that costs the theater maybe $ _num_ !
i checked online and the only place it was playing was the cheap theater .
this is the theater i spent my teenage years in .
walking in , i was n't expecting it to be much different .
the whole experience was awful .
i could not wait for it to be over .
i would not go here ever .
seems like the same old theater that it was in the _num_ 's .
filthy , dirty and disgusting .
$ _num_ admission and $ _num_ on tuesdays .
the picture show , $ _num_ regular and $ _num_ on tuesdays .
pizza was okay ; better than domino 's but nothing special .
the place might have gotten better , might still be the same .
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
, cuz this one 's made the do n't believe the hype list .
they got the steak , cheese and peppers just right .
see update below .
house salads were ... house salads .
nothing special there .
however , the service has been getting bad .
