START what say did you?
START your authority i know about, but the screens stay up.

START take much chances you, councilman.
START if you, i were you, think about saving my life, would i.

START true, that is.
START why, thank you, doctor. just won my fourth game, i have.
START for yourself observe. to king's pawn four rook.
START well, why just sitting there are you?
START transporter room, stand by. beaming down, we are.
START for the defence counsel?
START objection! rested his case, counsel for the defence has.
START this evidence, of what nature is?
START tell you, i cannot, have to show you, i will.
START is saving an innocent man's career a theatric? i.
START kindly direct their remarks to the bench, counsels will.
START object! making a conclusion would the witness be.
START be beyond what man aboard ship would it not?
START and at the moment, no records officer, you have.
START your pardon i beg?
START by no means adjourned, this court is, mister cogley.
START captain, maintaining an engine crew aboard are you?

START and the enterprise, so must. goodbye, jim.
START very good lawyer, she is.
START she is indeed.
START it, what is, webb?
START blip, sir. just came on the screen.
START how read you it?

START still with us, mister scott is.
START yes, sir. helm answering. sluggish, she is sluggish, sir.
START it on audio put.
START captain, getting ground to air transmission i am.
START picking up, sir, but still slow in responding, is she.
START breaking up, aircraft is, captain.
START right, that is. step off the transporter, you can.
START relax, captain, among friends, you are. captain james t, am i. kirk.
START kirk here. it, what is, mister spock?
START only twelve like it in the fleet, there are.
START i, neither have.
START captain christopher, my first officer, this is, lieutenant commander spock.
START very well, mister spock. your mind anything else on?
START your logic, most annoying, can be.
START computer, address me in that manner you will not. compute.
START an unfortunate tendency to giggle, it also has.
START afraid you will have to, i am. we, send you back, cannot.
START report, i would report, if i could. take the risk we cannot.
START for his disposition recommendation, dear?
START captain christopher. captain christopher? security, the captain, this is.
START yes. but in that position yet we are not.
START glad to hear it, i am.
START maybe retrained could he be, reeducated.
START sounding like spock, you now are.
START if going to get nasty, you are, going to leave, i am.
START to forget his family could he be retrained? his children?
START just a joke, is it, captain.
START you said, some additional information, you had, mister spock?
START my computations i made an error in.
START oh? an historic occasion, could this be.
START primitive computer. seen them demonstrated in museums i have.
START to start it i intend not.
START how long been down there now have they?
START well, should they be coming up not?
START that, what was?
START what, what was?
START hear anything i did not.
START that noise. coming from one of these things, is it.
START you are stay right where.
START know in a moment, we will, doctor.
START spock here. all right are you, captain?
START i believe not there'll be trouble in that respect, captain.
START to remain where he is our guest seems quite satisfied.
START try the darkroom, we will.
START all right. the other one, where is?
START no. nobody, been able to, should have.
START quite correct, your decision to beam up was, mister sulu.
START believe me, colonel, believe me you would not.
START try to be funny, do not. how get in did you?
START of thin air i popped in out.
START no, colonel. i know, no game, is it.
START all right. what say your name was did you?
START for the fourth time, james t, my name is. kirk.
START you, i told you, believe me you would not.
START colonel, with that would you mind being careful?
START sabotage something did i?
START here for, is that what you are? nothing at all?
START that is what would have happened if you had interfered not.
START to be just about right that ought.
START do that i cannot, captain.
START if something went wrong.
START in fact, i do. but to a certain point only.
START do that all the time do they?
START hungry are you?
START you like, what would?
START yes, i do. he doing here what's?
START be a fool, do not. you know what's at stake.
START explain your presence on the base you cannot.
START go home, you will, christopher but, do it our way, you will.
START i suspected he might wish to return with us not.
START to beam up four, mister sulu.
START maximum now, it is, sir. fighting it, she is.
START broken free and heading back, have we.
START to transporter room bridge. captain christopher.
START coming up on earth fast, are we, captain. ready are you?
START twenty minutes, sir. close will it be.
START to transporter room bridge. to energise prepare.
START be close enough for a visual contact, you should.
START mirages we track not.
START to transporter room bridge, to energise prepare.
START our reading what's, mister spock?
START our century approaching, captain. begin now, braking should.
START to engineering bridge. begin full braking power.
START to go fifty years.
START still with us, mister scott is.
START starfleet control, the enterprise, this is. captain kirk speaking.
START starfleet control, repeating message. home, the enterprise is. kirk out.
START enjoy commodore travers, you will. he sets a good table.
START good, commodore. on our way, are we.
START beam down immediately, we will, commodore. kirk out.
START perhaps, captain, but nevertheless.
START doctor, sensualist, you are.
START to enterprise kirk. red alert.

START captain, coming under attack, are we. unidentified ship quartering in.
START firing phasers, captain. screens up, the alien has, too.
START under attack are you, captain?
START helpless down here, are we. and the enterprise.
START an experienced combat officer, sulu is.
START of this place can you remember the layout? the arsenal?
START risk it, i will.
START captain, all right are you?
START your photon torpedoes arm.
START get visual contact, we cannot. too far away, she is.
START clear, captain, but you.
START never mind about me. my ship protect!
START he, how is, doctor?
START moving, they are moving. got to get to the captain, have i.
START of orbit sulu's taken her out.
START lang, they got lang, sir.
START see them did you?
START an evaluation, mister kelowitz. where think they are do you?
START it, a lot closer to them, will be. stand clear.
START me what happened can you tell?
START orbit decaying, mister spock. to atmosphere ten seconds.
START totally illogical. no chance, there was.
START exactly what i mean, that is.
START getting hot, is it.
START mister spock, stubborn man, you are.
START thank you, yeoman. sufficient, that is.
START you need sleep, captain. if out of line it is not.
START to my quarters have doctor mccoy's report channeled, lieutenant.

START yes, sir. completed the specimen survey, we have.

START what think you you are doing?
START where get it did you, mister sulu?
START doctor mccoy's rabbit, sir. gone through here, he must have.
START well, it, been worse, could have.
START seen the rabbit, could you have.
START and you being the very serious young.
START good. got a personal grudge against that rabbit i have, jim.
START finnegan? believe it i cannot.
START all right, try that one again, let us. go!
START it, what was?
START barrows, me a report give.
START imagining all this are you sure you are not?
START like don juan sounds.
START with you, mister sulu was. he now, where is?
START with her stay, doctor.
START jim, darling, me, it is me. ruth, it is ruth.
START it matters not. of that matters none.

START all that is not. my phaser so's.
START good. use your help, we can.
START stranded down here, we are, captain?
START until all about, we can find out what this is.
START no one here there is.
START talk like that, do not.
START that way. spread out. find it, let us.
START it is, it is. to blame, am i.
START like a dummy, it is, captain. it could be alive not.
START saying this is a plant are you, mister spock?
START it, what is?
START it hurt us can?
START it makes a strafing run not unless.
START gone, he is gone. dragged off.
START scientific fact, mccoy's death is.
START i was, thinking about the academy, i was. my days.
START finnegan. finnegan! to my people what's been happening?
START take sulu. find mccoy's body. my problem, this man is.
START an order that is, mister spock.
START you feel that can?
START finnegan. one thing.
START not bad. for things kind of makes up, huh, jim?
START of things a lot. to my people what's been happening?
START enjoy it did you, captain?
START which been formulating i supports a theory have.
START to be thinking about dangerous if we happen.

START no idea that history was your specialty i had.
START their war, mister stiles. not yours. forget it, do not.
START energise main phasers, mister styles. to full power all weapons.
START to full power all weapons. phaser control room.
START sir, with outpost four regaining contact. to speakers switching.
START kirk here. minutes away, are we, hansen. your status what's?
START for us can you locate the intruder?
START your screen lock us onto.
START phaser capacity, you have? still out of range we are.
START trying to, sir. they not acknowledge.
START of the intruder position, mister spock.
START disappeared. for just a moment interesting how they became visible.
START to full magnification go.
START on full mag, screen is, sir.

START eight light years off our course, benecia colony is.
START to personnel files data on question submitted.
START sending him back, am i.
START spared the dubious benefits of alcohol, my father's race was.
START illogical for him to bring those players aboard, it was.
START it occurred. it, i dismissed it.

START very old, it is.
START count on it, you can.
START me about the women in your world tell, captain.
START me about it tell.
START what would to know you like?
START heard of it i have.
START unfortunately, he was the first not.
START karidian to do with it, what has?
START to the day where kodos disappeared his history begins almost.
START you think jim suspects, kodos, is he?
START not me. down, i am down. in the engineering room.
START sore, i think his heart is.
START i do for you, what can, riley?
START well, not, you are, and prove it to you, i will.
START back, i will be, though forever, it takes forever.
START my heart is where.
START how'd that you like, riley?
START got to pull him through, you have.
START i am sure i can not.
START to poison him someone tried.
START when finished logging it i have.
START he make it, will?
START got a good chance, he is.
START for you can we predict the same, captain?
START all right, mister spock. have it, let us.
START witness, lieutenant riley was. so were you.
START to kill him someone tried.
START been an accident, could have.
START happen, it could happen.
START doing, i know what he is, and i like not it.
START his job, it is, and you know it.
START and proven, you also know that nothing is.
START not, i am not. interested in justice, i am.
START are you? are you sure it is vengeance not?
START shh. listen. hear it do you? that low hum.
START stay, you cannot.
START go on. this section block off. hurry. find it, i will.
START i hoped, have respected my privacy, you would, captain.
START sorry to hear that, i am.
START believe that i am do you?
START an actor now, you are. you twenty years ago, what were?
START my parts very quickly i learn.
START kodos, he was whoever.
START but not, he did not. and made its judgment, history has.
START who, to be, have i?
START i believe, a match, have we, captain.
START made your point, you have, doctor.
START whither wilt thou lead me? speak, go no further, i will.
START speak. bound to hear, i am.
START riley, to the sickbay get back.
START my father he murdered, and my mother.
START wrong i am not.
START an order, it is. me the weapon give.
START to sickbay now get back. go on.
START going beautifully, is it. it, what is? what's wrong?
START what saying are you?

START speaking you are not, yet you, i hear you.
START got, it is captain pike they have. help, he needs help.
START rigel seven, this is.
START please, hide ourselves, we must.
START his brain the talosians controlled.
START quick. if you attack while it is looking not.
START but only a dream, it is.
START to kill him as you did here before, you have.
START it, what is? why stopped the images have they?
START to know why i demand.
START if patient, you will be, to your questions the answers.
START forgotten, perhaps they made me out of dreams you have.
START wear whatever you wish, i can, you wish be anything.
START fool, you are.
START perhaps if you asked me some questions, answer, could i.
START they control my mind, how far can?
START but to trick me with their illusions they try.
START war, of centuries ago thousands.
START why it is so barren up there, that is?
START or of zoo specimens like me sit probing minds.
START you said that if i answered questions.
START why? to maintain a supply of zoo specimens just?
START with one of his animals is the keeper actually communicating?
START and if i prefer.
START to starve? of punishment you overlook the unpleasant alternative.
START very interesting, that is.
START to the female now.
START startled, you were. you reading my mind then weren't?
START to attract a mate it became necessary.
START first, of protectiveness an emotion. of sympathy now one. excellent.
START good to be home is it?
START stop it. you care what they will do to us, do not?
START nice place, here, you have, mister pike.
START would you say it was worth a man's soul not?
START no! me finish let!
START the only ones transported, we were.
START it is fair not. you need not them.
START he needs you not. already picked me, he is.
START picked her? for what? i not understand.
START now, fine choice for intelligent offspring, there is.
START fair it is not. what you asked, i did.
START hold still, or break your neck, i will.
START hurt them, do not. they mean not to be evil.
START had some samples of how good they are, have i.
START your ship. release me, or destroy it, we will.
START deserted you, it seems the talosians have.
START gentlemen, moment, please.
START as charged guilty.
START to commander bridge.
START as you see, to escape accomplished nothing your attempt.
START i contact our ship want to.
START this a deception is? intend to destroy yourselves do you?
START that, what is?
START but some form of trade would not, mutual cooperation.
START get back to the ship, let us.
START i cannot. i, go with you, cannot.
START you see why i, go with you, cannot.
START the female's true appearance, this is.
START give her back her illusion of beauty, you will?
START mister spock, coming on again, the system is.
START oh, jim, i just, understand this, cannot.
START if my first officer states he received a transmission from.
START when promoted to fleet captain, he was.
START your age about. big, handsome man, vital, active.
START his problem what's, commodore?
START well, true of course that is.
START she knew you she merely mentioned, sir.

START security clearance, i have, chief.
START mister spock, this is.
START stand by. warp out of orbit in one hour, will we.
START he live, how long will?
START bones, anything to do with spock, could this have?
START you at all i read not, jim.
START also half human, he is.
START make a false entry he would not.
START well, it, what is? sickness? injury? it, how bad is?
START with half vulcan science officer named spock.
START commodore! captain pike, gone, he is gone!
START mendez here. it, what is?
START going, the enterprise knows where she is, mister hansen.
START to hail us someone's trying, sir.
START your orders, you have, mister hansen. make no contact, we will.
START headed for talos four, spock is, all right.
START to sensors lock on. measure object now following the enterprise.
START computed. already past point of safe return, shuttlecraft is.
START of oxygen left two hours.
START some logical reason for going there, would spock have.
START maybe. just gone mad, maybe he is.
START computer control. to shuttlecraft following us lock on.
START to tape abel seven baker go. execute instructions.

START beginning to talk like a doctor, now you are, bartender.
START and not, i vote we do. deadlock, and since i am.
START settled into orbit, we have, sir.
START of earth zero point nine.
START man: men, they are men. humans, they are humans.
START the same old earth, and see it very soon, you will.
START yes, affirmative on the.
START i think, time to show the captain our secret, is it.
START excellent, their health is, almost too good.
START i, understand i not.
START you will. perfect choice, you are.
START it, what is?
START for you plead signal, sir. go ahead, uhura.
START sir, decline, i respectfully decline.
START native of capella four, is it, is it not?
START beautiful, it is beautiful, but also very deadly.
START hard about, helmsman. for twenty four mark seven change course.
START captain, that ship is responding not.
START captain, making visual contact, they are.
START it on the screen put, lieutenant.
START never heard that language before, i have.
START no use, sir. refusing to answer, she is.
START yes, scotty, it, what is?
START mister arex, our speed, what is?
START sir, release the tractor beam i cannot.
START what you mean, mister sulu?
START to manual override go.
START still starship personnel, we are, captain.
START aye, captain. almost gone, our engines are.
START contact in thirty nine seconds. thirty eight, thirty seven.
START thirteen, twelve, eleven.
START to execute course change get ready, mister sulu.
START impossible. been destroyed instantly, should it have.
START got to work, it is.
START fourteen seconds, thirteen, twelve.
START never mind, mister spock, no use, it is.
START we, where are?
START yes, scotty. we doing down there, how are?
START responding to our call, the alien ship is, captain.
START little choice, we have.
START take a remarkable coincidence, that would, mister spock.
START my son may i introduce, karl four.
START then the young child in the playpen.
START true that is, captain.
START welcome to use my ship, you are, captain.
START to babel after all we just might get you, commodore.
START meeting the speed of karla five's unmanned vessel, are we, captain.
START our course, how is, mister sulu?
START too young, is he, captain.
START yes, captain, but fill in for you, who will?
START what you mean?
START you mean i see what.
START tractor beam? how we do that, spock?
START you say whatever. what shall i do?
START correct, you are, of course. commodore april, yours, command is.
START commodore? captain april i am, mister spock.
START very good. your post at the navigation console assume.
START vessel armed, captain. to impact nine seconds. eight, seven,
START but the enterprise crew, all children, are they.
START blossomed again, i see your flower has.
START if so kind you would be, captain.
START slaughter? of people hundreds?
START me see that let.
START that means not he was responsible for it.
START tell, his trial will, captain.
START trial? you mean kangaroo court. heard about dramian justice, have i.
START captain, becoming emotional, you are.
START or my part a tragic mistake on.
START that i buy not, bones. guard!
START it is there.
START sure, you are?
START of arrival estimated time, mister sulu?
START contact, shall i make, sir?
START planning something, you are, captain?
START my guess unless i miss, friend demos, that is.
START he attacks what if, sir?
START but the hangar doors are open not, captain.
START to the federation now i demand that you report!
START i would, but out of communications range, we unfortunately are.
START stowaway, you are, commander.
START been tricked i have.
START sure it is safe, you are, captain?
START decidedly. difference, there is, captain.
START ever been to i not the most enchanting place have.
START of flowers plagues seldom leave behind fields, captain.
START outsiders they like not.
START an outsider surely you are not, commander. dramian, you are.
START inhospitable or not, he must get away not.
START disappeared, he is disappeared. almost as if he dematerialised, it is.
START advise against that, i would, captain.
START mind if i ignore your advice i am sure you will not.
START seem to be advisable, caution would, captain.
START on the line, bones' life is, mister spock.
START cave dwellers? of your civilisation in the midst?
START of your doctor mccoy and his inhumane methods a result.
START you say it, demos, but not, that does.
START but how survive the plague did he?
START then tell us, you can. remember do you?
START get underway for dramia let us.
START sir, that, who is?
START pour on the coal i will, captain.
START hope the trial hasn't started, let us.
START yes, mister spock. it, what is?
START hardly fit to testify at the trial, he is, captain.
START got to save him, have we.
START it is that not. it is.
START captain, blue, you are.
START been activated, general order six has?
START good. to sickbay report, mister sulu.
START but sir, monitor, who will?
START i assure you, capable, am i, mister sulu.
START to get mccoy, have we. must find an antidote.
START impossible. stricken, he too is.
START to get mccoy got.
START doctor, with me, just come, please.
START plague? why did you tell me not?
START doctor, i am, spock, doctor. get us beamed aboard.
START blast it, spock, work harder. in the terminal stage, they are.
START bones, it, that is. aurora, changing colour.
START jim? aurora? what.
START bones, it, you did!
START and forget about a certain stowaway we will.
START apologise, we must apologise.
START that supposed to mean, what is?
START hippocrates would have approved of lame excuses not, doctor.
START captain, established contact with the romulan commander, i have.
START for this unprovoked attack i demand an explanation.
START strange. on the charts it is not.
START mister spock, our chances, what are?
START after that ride, use some repairs, i could.
START the repairs progressing, how are, scotty?
START how like you that? so did mine.
START beginning to wonder, i am, bones, beginning to wonder i am.
START you got there, what have, spock?
START sorry, i am sorry, spock, your, it is your.
START officer scott, will you join us for lunch not?
START hey, wait a minute. we did cause this to happen not.
START okay, gone far enough, this whole thing has!
START when you all finish laughing, appreciate an explanation, i would.
START captain, laugh, i never laugh.
START no joke, this is, sir.
START amazing. covered with ice, this deck is.
START to one guilty party the evidence all points, captain.
START you know who's behind these stunts you mean?
START well, it be what'll, swim at the beach?
START then it is woods.
START ah, more like it, that now is. shall we?
START strange, that is. repeat the call.
START so peaceful, it is. so relaxing.
START and of all best, no practical jokes.
START that, what was?
START i am sure not. like someone chuckling it almost sounded.
START there, again, is it. definitely laughing at us, someone is.
START hear that right, did i?
START never tell i will.
START well, be, i will be.
START compliance, i suggest compliance, captain.
START with sugar on say pretty please.
START temper, temper. cool you off, perhaps this will.
START for a nap time, old girl. captain's orders.
START vacate sir? but.
START you bloody big scatterbrain. your monumental mind make up.
START we do to stop it, what can?
START i, define the field's energy base, cannot, captain, but.
START tchar. of the seven gods in the name, why?
START now, fly and fight as a skorr, you can.
START no offence, little ones, but me tackle him let.
START with you last week, captain.
START for retrieval call, now.
START me die let.
START going back with us, you are.
START what about tchar? how are you punish him going to?
START what you mean?
START we gone, how long were?
START long? about two minutes, i guess. understand i not.
START against all orders, it was.
START apparently desperate, the need was.
START the most impossible, you vulcans are, unimaginative.
START bones, that is helping the situation not.
START to their lot according, they beamed down six weeks ago.
START of me careless, mister spock. planetary life forms?
START jim, if lost, the others are, take the risk why?
START still a risk, is it.
START then beam back up, we will.
START to navigate on land it may be able.
START it can i know.
START get out of here, let us.
START strange you did get a voice reply not.
START there, many reasons why we did not, could be.
START of the neck concentrate on the underside.
START undamaged, i am undamaged. doctor mccoy, where is?
START get you out, will we, bones.
START thanks. running out under there, the air was.
START you hurt were?
START captain, the beast, seem familiar to you did it?
START full of sand, my shoes are.
START doctor, amazing, your lack of scientific interest is.
START seen stranger things, i have, mister spock.
START to enterprise kirk.
START know i not. but at least, alive, are they.
START apparently alive. be sure we cannot.
START to believe they are i choose.
START to test the water first allow me, doctor.
START captain, too pure, the water is.
START nonetheless, too pure, is it.
START in other words, too good to be true, it is.
START terraforming is new not. it implies intelligent life forms.
START unless, of course, the pattern, the random choice is.
START spock, ever say anything straight out do you?
START gentlemen, please. work to do we have.
START still alive, are we, are we not?
START if true, that is, spock, then.
START been travelling for hours, we have. where taking us are they?
START captain, it is there.
START five square kilometres, that must be.
START if the builders, these are, an admirable feat, is it.
START congratulations, doctor. most logical assumption.
START and definitely on the inside, are we.
START communicate with them some way, surely we can.
START you mean, some kind of a zoo, is it?
START or maybe they see how our toys work want to.
START possibility, that too is.
START got to communicate with them we have.
START well, so for mythology much.
START real grass, this is.
START zoo? no animal, am i.
START been expecting you we have.
START your communicator signal we heard.
START then why did you warn us not?
START six of you on the mission, there were.
START check her out i will. help i maybe can.
START you learned about the aliens what have?
START tried an escape have you?
START tried to communicate have you?
START company, we seem to have.
START to be getting a response you seem.
START laughing at me, my impression is that they are.
START captain kirk, mister spock, nancy randolph, this is, our navigator.
START she, how is?
START the lactrans outside, what they do?
START feed us or do we shift for ourselves do they.
START to the same place always?
START then be there, my equipment should.
START then it that way think about, doctor.
START food. but it is feeding time not.
START all here, it is. damaged it they have not.
START of the situation what's your evaluation, markel?
START for the curators of a zoo a natural reaction.
START how? we, get through to them, cannot?
START telepathically, they communicate telepathically.
START between themselves, yes, but, mister spock, are vulcans telepathic not?
START how much learned have you?
START of us what's their impression?
START with another move how about coming up, then?
START aye, and that tricky devil, where is?
START totally depleted, scanners indicate the enterprise shields are, sir.
START sir, frozen, our weaponry is.
START to elysia welcome. devna, of laws interpreter.
START how freeze my weaponry did you?
START getting out, we are.
START then pretty quick, we'd better do it, captain.
START if we find an answer, still take time, will it.
START that is just what we have got not.
START our dilithium crystals, is it, sir. deteriorating rapidly, they are.
START your computer got any miracles in, spock?
START to predict impossible, captain.
START what see you beyond your eyes, magen?
START gently, good magen. to us now return.
START impossible, it is impossible.
START covered every possibility have you? every factor?
START his crew and his ship unnecessarily jeopardising?
START but with the klothos this involves combining our ship.
START correct, that is.
START good. contact kor right away i will.
START it, what is?
START against our laws to try to escape it is not.
START they die even if?
START their choice, it is.
START forgive me, commander. overcome by the moment, i was. goodbye.
START the stories of his being half human, true, must be.
START his mind perhaps the time continuum affected.
START become affected i wonder if we all have not.
START think my commander had manoeuvred brilliantly, i would.
START and arranged, it can be, practically speaking?
START your pardon beg, sir.
START it, what is, gabler.
START lost, we were lost.
START jim, worried about spock, am i. he is just acting normal not.
START under much pressure, he is, bones.
START talk to him, i will, bones. all i can do, is it.
START yes, captain. why you ask?
START the device, you have, kaz?
START go, you could. willing to take passengers, are we.
START we believe it, done, can be.
START then i shall interfere with your dream not, captain.
START get away from here, human. my woman, this is.
START fail, you will.
START take these renegades with you, you would?
START them, we need them.
START to accelerate to warp six ready.
START enterprise, xerius, this is! come in, enterprise.
START sir, calling us, xerius is. he says, urgent, is it.
START go off, will it when you reach warp eight.
START it is there, sir.
START it matters not, bones.
START what matters, that is.
START entering its cycle of strongest emissions, arachna is, captain.
START it on the speaker put.
START signals appear random. beyond our reception capability, perhaps some are.
START natural radio source newly energised by, could be.
START intersat? been out of use for two centuries, that is.
START no, sir. repeated twice in the transmission, was it.
START mister sulu, for cepheus lay in a course.
START waste of time if you ask me, it is.
START for a single elliptic orbit set.
START to engineering bridge. scotty, your engines, how are?
START like happy kittens purring, captain.
START nothing, jim. of shock the gossamer mice show no signs.
START know yet, do not.
START but the hardest, dilithium molecules are, most rigid.
START mister scott! with the circuit work more trouble.
START you sound like, blathering, you are, man. wait, coming, i am coming.
START spock, slumping are you?
START captain, happening, the most incredible thing is.
START we know. apparently expanded, the whole ship has.
START complex beyond anything in my experience, only that it is.
START kirk here. how holding out are they, scotty?
START to sickbay kirk.
START bones, i need some answers. to us what's happening?
START the test tissue, there is, jim, with the stable infrared compared.
START then right, spock's theory is. contracting, we are contracting.
START agreed. and accelerating, it is accelerating.
START it keep on, how long can?
START miss chapel, the composition of this decoration, what is?
START are all our uniforms xenylon not?
START yes, and all been shrinking proportionately with us, have they.
START affected, that means only organic matter is. but how?
START the strands would break not, jim, just quit winding, they would.
START then calculate the limits to our shrinkage, we can.
START possible, it is possible. feed the data into the computer banks, will i.
START spock, we ultimately shrink, how small will?
START sulu! his leg's broken i think. need a splint, we will.
START get him to sickbay let us. to stations every one back.
START certainly worth a try, it is.
START in the lab shelf supplies, it is. get it, will i.
START for you no more climbing heights, nurse. got that clear?
START yes, captain. but also got the miniature laser i have.
START it, how is, sulu?
START error when contacting http://www.yodaspeak.co.uk/index.php
START through, results on dna reduction limits have come, captain.
START they, what are?
START of thirty two point nine factor.
START yes, captain. of enterprise controls well past the operative point.
START as good a place as any to beam down, it is.
START to engineering kirk. scotty, you hear me can?
START i think i see.
START scotty, you is it?
START captain, deafen us for sure, you will!
START you forbid me after what, done to my people, you have?
START my officers, where are?
START spock, the terratins, who are? from, where'd they come?
START bridge crew, to beam up prepare.
START subspace radio now operational, sir. reading, starbase twenty three is.
START mister arex, for immediate departure from this area prepare.
START to making it more than honorary we came rather close.
START think harry mudd is down there do you, spock?
START you just say why cannot, mudd's probably there.
START did, i just did, doctor.
START harry, darling. lonely for you, i was.
START please, darling, to the ship with me come back.
START three hundred credits, or the.
START with free will i surrender myself. of the law mercy.
START fine. see you in court, will i, harry.
START minor bruise, captain. live, he will live.
START and to swindle honest miners came here.
START really a very attractive intelligence, your mister spock is.
START it, what is?
START think about it, darling. with you mister spock in love.
START let you know the results of my analysis i will.
START it, what is?
START absorbed, a temporary effect as the liquid is.
START better, i feel better.
START i tell you did not?
START you should, be in the brig, you should, harry.
START oh, you are right, darling.
START injured are you, miss chapel?
START no. no, i, fine, i am fine. feeling all right are you?
START would you like me to not, well, stay? help you?
START illogical that would be, miss chapel.
START yes. yes, stupid would it be.
START harry mudd, you swindling.
START come to collect on your guarantee, i have, mister mudd.
START completely successful you are implying the potion was not?
START it on screen put.
START mudd. and christine, he has christine. in danger, she is. my love.
START going planet side, he is.
START no. with my christine not.
START spock, you are obviously yourself not. maybe some rest.
START then transport down with you, i will.
START jim, is that wise, his condition in?
START jim, this in the shuttlecraft bay the search party found.
START of mudd's love crystals one.
START lucky for us they not work.
START it out check, bones. me an immediate report send.
START well, i had planned on it not.
START thanks jim. good to have a friend like you, it is.
START darling, all right are you?
START kirk, of here get us out.
START they are responding not.
START worry, do not. you, safe, will be, darling.
START coming closer, they are.
START my affair, that is.
START get a few things straight, i think we should.
START yes, to control our emotional reactions, have we.
START the effect of the potion last, how long does, harry?
START harry, any of the crystals left, do you have?
START contact, i made contact.
START you record his confession may i help, nurse?
START you? choose, you would be the last person i would.
START guarantee it, i can.
START yes, as beautiful as i remembered it just. nothing's changed.
START you so very much thank.
START it is hard to believe they are real not.
START lovely. they just make not them like that anymore.
START with his head off. with his head off!
START to transporter room uhura. the emergency, what is? respond, please.
START i see. bones, you thinking about that book were?
START mister sulu, experience any strange occurrences did you?
START somewhere underground, his quarters are, are they not?
START be, any indication of where that would?
START you are being detained so your master will leave not.
START your name for it, that is.
START why think you the enterprise is my master?
START redundant, your questioning is.
START word meaning to cease to function, that is?
START built like a fortress, this planet is.
START enterprise, read me do you?
START to bridge scott. of phaser bore commencing beam down.
START to bridge scott. got problems we have.
START an inscription there is, several languages.
START well, gentlemen, it appears that, on our own now, are we.
START been changed before, programmes have, lieutenant.
START believe me. no reason to harm them, there is.
START they serve the sky machine, but essential they are not.
START oh, but they are. most essential, they are.
START attempt to disconnect me, do not.
START with your function you sound less than enchanted.
START fighting us, it is. there, a faster way, must be.
START what you want, signs pointing the way?
START doctor, i only meant it seems like, wasting time, are we.
START sorry, i am sorry, sulu. worried about uhura i am.
START dead, phasers are! for the cave run!
START to amuse our amusement park no longer seems content.
START please, call off that beast. why doing this are you?
START mister arex, what doing are you?
START to that i believe you may know the answer, doctor.
START me? what talking about are you?
START and to or not whether it wants.
START perfect, bones. which arm want do you?
START i submit, captain, that, the more qualified subject, am i.
START for one thing my knowledge of computers.
START and for another his tough vulcan hide.
START your arguments seem sound both. go ahead, bones.
START find ten cc's adequate, i believe you will.
START been almost five minutes, it is, captain.
START of mechanical nursemaid it looks like some kind.
START i think of that, not in my wildest dreams would!
START visitor, we have.
START got to make those rocks, have we. our only chance, is it.
START the planet's master computer, i presume you are.
START to the keeper what happened?
START old, he was old. to function he ceased.
START sky machines? slaves? what talking about are you?
START new computer!
START dead end, it is!
START masters of the sky machine, you are?
START shock, this is.
START mister scott, now functioning normally, all systems are.
START we must have more of these discussions while, here, you are.
START mister spock, to take on that duty would you care?
START find it most interesting, i would, captain.
START then agreed, it is agreed. to enterprise kirk.
START reverse power. our position hold. deflector screens on.
START deflectors up. sir, taking considerable power to hold position, it is.
START repaired, can everything be, captain.
START an incredible experience, captain. this scientifically fascinating i find.
START ride her through we will, bones. we do, what else can?
START her through where ride?
START we, where are?
START captain, the subspace radio. dead, it is dead.
START stopped, even the ship's chronometers have.
START ship's life support systems fading. jim, oxygen, we need oxygen.
START jim, got to do something, we have.
START ah, humans. lovely primitive humans. you do anything right, cannot?
START working, everything is, my friends.
START it cannot. logical it is not.
START look around you, spock. working, everything is.
START welcome! searching for me, i knew eventually humans would come.
START you, who are?
START this all quite absorbing i find, doctor.
START probably because you are not very natural to begin with, spock.
START play, children will.
START you superstitiously call magic our universe operates by what.
START just my imagination but, i know this is.
START love philter?
START it, what is? what's wrong?
START captain kirk, what.
START all right, everyone onboard is?
START mister scott, bewildered, i am bewildered, all, that is. but enough, that is.
START if it there lucien put.
START weapons status, mister scott? to protect ourselves, we may have.
START forget it, spock. work it will not.
START what doing are you?
START to protect ourselves learning, lucien.
START but you made mistakes, your powers used.
START and for it burned. burned!
START and loneliness and fear.
START i will, asmodeus. i am of earth not.
START yes, different, you are. hear a defence, the court will.
START as my first witness i call lucien.
START indeed, captain. elaborate could you?
START submit, captain. the power to fight us you have not.
START captain, you know use the magic. believe.
START i not understand.
START all systems go, captain. back to normal, we are.
START really matter does it?
START confused, life readings are, sir. i, decipher them, cannot.
START it, what is, mister sulu?
START going to have to see this yourself, you are, sir.
START that thing, what is?
START ow! been a thorn, must have.
START been poisoned, he is. unknown toxin.
START you help him can?
START get a correlation with any known poison i cannot.
START be necessary that will not.
START you, who are?
START called agmar, i am. help, i believe we can.
START getting a reading on them are you?
START moment, captain. unclear, the results are.
START captain, of botanical origin, these beings are.
START so seem, it would seem.
START to the planet phylos welcome.
START to him what happened?
START minor achievement.
START been humanoid aliens here before, there have.
START of communication your method.
START come. show you, will i.
START happening, we had no way of knowing what was.
START alive then, you were?
START they will work on any setting not, sir.
START i think, after you, is it, jim.
START to enterprise kirk.
START what think you they will do with us, sir?
START sorry, i am sorry, captain kirk, but no other way, there was.
START what talking about are you? where taken spock have they?
START spock, where is?
START my first officer not without.
START to enterprise kirk. beam us up, scotty.
START hate to resort to clubs and knives i would.
START aye, sir, but it i like not.
START i, neither do, but to be necessary it appears. energise.
START sure i can take too much of this i am not.
START believe it, i cannot.
START getting ready to go on a trip, looks like they are.
START agmar said, a peaceful people, were they.
START they are sure, now. but what about before?
START of keniclius or spock any indication?
START your work carry on?
START to spock or the master what if something happens?
START like that just, captain?
START though here, the way is, gentlemen.
START hear something did you?
START sure i am not.
START much further now not, captain.
START operate they not. agmar!
START it, i see it. it, i see it. keep going.
START dying, he is dying. to his brain something's happened. electrical activity decreasing.
START captain, out, i am out. empty, the chemical sprayer is.
START of my way out, mister. an order that is.
START no use, it is, mister scott. get through i cannot.
START our ship calling that is, spock. you answer them.
START slipping away, spock is. there is much time left not.
START sure we are getting through, am i, but acknowledging they are not.
START what i call close that is, mister scott.
START hope it was information they could use, let us.
START no! the mould, broken, must be.
START spock: so i believe not.
START no! our dream must be allowed to die not.
START murderer! killed spock, you have!
START spock. spock, you old.
START honoured would i be. if allowed, will i be.
START inscrutable? sulu, the most scrutable man i know, you are.
START identified the vessel have you, mister spock?
START impossible that is, spock. over five years carter winston's been missing.
START incredible. him, it is him.
START you gentlemen know me it seems.
START my fiancee? this starship anne's aboard?
START right as usual, spock is, bones.
START quite human are you suggesting i am not, doctor?
START completed, the captain is inquiring if the examination is, doctor.
START yes, so, i suppose so.
START sorry, i am sorry, anne. meet again, i never thought we would.
START carter, it, what is?
START but survive, you did. alive, you are, and together again, we are.
START intruding i hope i am not, captain.
START no, come in, mister winston.
START weren't you your cabin going to, sir?
START mister sulu, for ratar three lay in a direct course.
START the order, that was, helmsman.
START an admirable mission, captain, but our ship if we endanger.
START been his reputation, that has.
START the conn, you have, mister spock.
START take the conn, i will, mister spock.
START the reason you gave, i believe that was, captain.
START examine you, perhaps doctor mccoy should, captain.
START doctor, what i do? i still love him.
START not, i have not. i do, what can?
START i do for you, what can, captain?
START i want a complete medical examination, bones. something's just happened.
START there are many places one could hide in here not.
START taken a little nap, i must have.
START something wrong about this room, there is.
START i think not so, doctor.
START that, i saw that, but i believe not it.
START to bridge spock. me on ship's audio put.
START anne, what doing are you?
START lieutenant nored, stopped him, you could have. you fire why did not?
START bridge, the captain, this is. what's happened?
START it was deliberate not, you, i assure you.
START like a few minutes to inform my crew, i would.
START seem so, it would.
START i will surrender my ship not.
START what doing are you?
START captain, coming down, our deflector shields are.
START to engineering bridge. scotty, to the shields what's happened?
START mister scott is here not, sir.
START him, we need him. override the controls and shut those doors.
START it take to fix, how long will?
START carter? what say did he?
START how die did he?
START so much like him, you are, his voice, his mannerisms.
START say he loved me, he did.
START but unfortunately, i cannot.
START without deflectors, just a clay pigeon for them, are we.
START suggest capitulation, practicality does, captain.
START captain, coming up again, the deflector shields are.
START only one shield, that is.
START yes, sir, but between us and the romulans, is it.
START someone tell me what's going on, will?
START that, what manner of beastie is?
START over, i assume the danger to your ship is.
START why do it did you?
START your mind about the romulans what changed?
START happen to me now, what will?
START captain, assign me that duty could you.
START but seem me, you have. you know what i am.
START know i not. i.
START the guard detail, you have, lieutenant.
START firing on him, they are.
START him, they got him.
START scotty, that pilot yet, have you got?
START dead, our engines are.
START work the phasers not, sir.
START well, always throw rocks, we could.
START scotty, get that pilot did you?
START but integrate him, i cannot. the system's been discoordinated.
START captain, message coming in, i have, sir.
START it on the viewscreen put.
START my ship release.
START that, what was? lieutenant, cut off that frequency.
START power, they still have? we still control them?
START captain, afford to lose that grain you cannot.
START incredible. require, the amount of energy that field must.
START they could maintain the stasis field not.
START down, apparently their battle capacity is. they only damaged it.
START veering off, are they.
START scotty, you integrate that pilot now can?
START so, i think so, captain.
START to the transporter room call mccoy. spock.
START him, you have got?
START to be it appears.
START to think about it i want not.
START and got tribbles with him, is he. tribbles!
START captain, safe tribbles, these are.
START no such thing as a safe tribble, there is.
START well, neat, at least it is.
START the klingons chasing you, why were, jones?
START i know, how should? notoriously bad tempers, klingons have.
START mention ecological sabotage, they did.
START me? saboteur? ridiculous.
START pretty emphatic, captain koloth was.
START what do did you?
START well, i did know it was a klingon planet not.
START captain, could we talk this over not? i did think so not.
START he really seems the saboteur type not, jim.
START captain, picking up a klingon battle cruiser, sensors are.
START quite a marksman, captain koloth is.
START changed course, have they. coming in again, they are.
START had enough time to recharge it perhaps they have not.
START or something else, the purpose of the attack was.
START well, mister spock, any ideas, you have?
START always throw tribbles at them, we could.
START i thought vulcans did have a sense of humour not.
START not, we do not, captain.
START of captain koloth's ship any sign?
START mister jones, in enough trouble already, you are.
START captain, harmless little tribble. they hurt, what can?
START hungry, they are hungry, captain.
START captain, coming back, the klingons are.
START of the devil speak.
START jim, something about these tribbles, there is.
START done it that is. caught, we are caught.
START help it, not if i can.
START are you going to sit down not, sir?
START stand, i think i will.
START mister scott, going to implement emergency defence plan b we are.
START yet you know not, do you?
START others, you must have.
START they completely overrun the planet jones sold before.
START and all you want that is?
START the glommer, we must have.
START my claim i withdraw.
START captain, filled with tribble, the engine room is.
START five seconds. four, three.
START it on ship's speaker put.
START more like music than a message, it is.
START captain, being probed, we are.
START from where? you trace it can?
START you identify it can?
START to be calling us it seems.
START strange. yes, the same feeling myself, i get.
START resemble a summons, it does.
START to a summons i find no resemblance, captain.
START you wanted me, lieutenant? all right are you?
START logically, created by the probe, we must assume they are.
START sir, what visions? anything we see not.
START miss chapel, you see not anything, either?
START no, so i think not, carver. do it, spock will.
START something compelling about it, there is.
START yes, it too i feel, bones.
START no apparent danger, there is, spock. go let us.
START here, they are here.
START oh, such wondrous ones. us, they honour us.
START how know you our names?
START the signal? distress call, it was not?
START to the slumber chambers take them. rest, they must rest.
START probably that nectar. potent as saurian brandy, it is.
START of medical summation, biological, astrophysical scans.
START to security officer davison lieutenant uhura.
START what doing are you?
START of this ship taking command.
START return to our duties aboard ship, we must.
START yes. duties. it, that is. duties. i have.
START go, we must go.
START of you very thoughtful, love.
START me keep it i wonder why they let.
START they saw no practical use in it perhaps.
START cortropine. could help. strong stimulant, is it.
START the urn. the only place, is it.
START they are here not, theela.
START you mean, actually draining our life forces, are they?
START we have, how long do, spock?
START to be aging ten years per day we seem, captain.
START ten years? in four days, dead, will we be!
START to enterprise spock.
START greetings. theela, i am theela. of this compound head female.
START to your ship return. you are wanted here not.
START until we find captain kirk, leave we will not.
START search the temple. of two parties.
START of them anywhere no sign.
START it, what is?
START spock, it is spock. panel somewhere, must there be.
START got to get out of here, we have.
START that, we tried that.
START wait! tell you everything, will i.
START see, we shall see. of the enterprise the men, reveal them.
START drowning, they are drowning! they, where are?
START many cusecs from here, the nearest water accumulation is.
START like a pool or a tub that looks.
START the urn in the garden, is it.
START no results, captain. tried everything we know, we have.
START the key, perhaps the transporter is.
START to what key?
START but never been done before, this has. it fails suppose?
START scotty, losing them, are we!
START work did it?
START more handsome than ever, you are.
START kept the agreement, tell captain kirk we have.
START we become as other women, how quickly will?
START only take a few months, doctor mccoy says it should.
START captain, now approaching sensor range of the cloud, we are.
START our present position put up, lieutenant arex.
START captain, disappeared from navigation scan, alondra has.
START the cloud, come between us and the planet, could have.
START spock, possible the cloud consumes planets is it?
START sir, changing course, the cloud is.
START but it continues on that course if.
START how much time have do they?
START certain there'd be planetwide panic, it is.
START of mantilles who's the governor, jim?
START captain, getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors, i am.
START still got us, is it.
START to fire all phasers into cloud mass prepare.
START firing. no effect, captain.
START to absorb the phaser energy the cloud appeared, captain.
START floating inside the cloud, we are.
START some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter, the objects are.
START scotty, for an antimatter charge prepare the shields.
START to my quarters transfer it.
START time to save some people, you have, bob.
START how are you choose going to?
START reached the entrance to the central core we have, captain.
START what we do now, knock?
START those things, what are?
START we have, how much time do?
START to maximum increase deflector shields.
START to maximum screens, sir.
START scotty, got ten minutes left, we have.
START holding, the force field is. go, let us.
START the brain located, where is?
START captain, living creature, this is. starfleet regulations.
START i believe, what i just said, that is, doctor.
START to engineering kirk.
START incoming message, sir. governor wesley of mantilles, is it.
START it on the viewscreen put, lieutenant.
START to mantilles thirty one minutes and four seconds, sir.
START bob, katie, where is?
START worry, do not, bon. she, all right, will be. goodbye.
START in time, can you do it?
START to mantilles twenty six minutes exactly, sir.
START ready, the procedure is, sir.
START mantilles, how near is, mister arex?
START your order awaiting, captain.
START stopped, the cloud has, sir.
START spock, it, you did! leaving, the cloud is.
START mister sulu, get out of here let us, through that grid.
START spock, what perceive did you?
START of the universe the wonders, captain. incredible, completely incredible.
START returning, the travellers are.
START what you mean, who's he? you know mister spock.
START not, afraid i do, jim.
START to enterprise kirk.
START you, who are?
START no, but reality, if it is, what happened?
START but changed, something was.
START also research the vulcan family history requested did you?
START correct that is not.
START in this case, it is.
START to thirty vulcan years past twenty.
START the date was.
START of tasmeen the twentieth day.
START how know you this?
START this cousin, his name, what was?
START spock, now, did selek look like you do?
START all, i hear all.
START possible if no other major factor is changed, it is.
START andorians are known for their charity not.
START ready to receive you, the time and place are.
START spock: that is true not. my father.
START peace and long life. of my family, you are?
START honoured, i am honoured. is something wrong, cousin?
START to our forefathers a family resemblance, no doubt.
START to understand him better than my husband you seem.
START but the twentieth day of tasmeen, tomorrow is.
START lost track of time, i seem to have.
START sarek, gone, our son and the visitor are.
START you think not he would harm spock?
START my duty, it was, spock.
START spock: always say thank you, mother says you should.
START known for her graciousness, the lady amanda is.
START you will i dare say. come now.
START your father's wish, that is?
START spock: how know did you?
START spock: dying is he?
START spock: bring a healer here, i can.
START late, the hour is. urgent, i trust your errand is?
START spock, you are, of sarek son, not are you?
START spock: healer, hurry.
START it will be long now not, old friend.
START face such a loss without tears, a vulcan would.
START spock: is there nothing, do, you can?
START necessary, i trust you can explain why it was?
START returning, the traveller is.
START to the ship i sent the others up. what happened?
START changed this time, one small thing was. pet died.
START enterprise, the captain, this is. to beam up two.
START to reverse course stand by.
START captain, the source of the radio emissions, that is.
START captain, still gaining speed, are we.
START no good, sir. still falling toward it, we are.
START we have, how much time do?
START captain, another signal, there is. listen.
START as she goes steady, mister sulu. maintain orbit.
START slingshot effect, mister spock? enough power, have we?
START need some time for the computations, i will, captain.
START coming from that ship, is it, captain.
START sure, you are, mister spock?
START mister spock, of that ship's power source any indication?
START now, a lighter and stronger material than anything we have.
START look, every pod, all been burst open, they have.
START aye, from the inside, of them from the looks.
START been some accident to get almost every pod, must have.
START to enterprise kirk.
START negative, captain. transmitting, it stopped transmitting when you beamed aboard.
START what make you of it, spock?
START me the creeps gives. like something's watching us i feel.
START it too i feel, captain.
START enterprise, read me do you? sulu?
START cut our way out of here, we can.
START you mean, trapped here, are we? no communication, nothing?
START to shield this room something. but it from what shield?
START aboard their ship, possibly from whatever had come.
START quite right, mister scott. of life no known form.
START it hold, will?
START it, what is?
START sure i am not, but i think.
START message from three hundred million years ago?
START to get a translation i may be able.
START of here get out! hurry!
START of cake piece, sir. now, here they come.
START captain, with you something's beamed aboard.
START it back out transport.
START to crew sickbay reports no injuries, sir.
START to hull or engines no damage, captain.
START of a heart like the beating.
START to sickbay bridge.
START something's jammed the circuits. magnetised, they are magnetised.
START you, i thank you, sir.
START off, phaser banks were, captain. themselves, they activated themselves.
START and mutual override did work not?
START sir, get into the core, we cannot.
START of all energy drained, sir.
START have a very small field, it would.
START activated, it is activated, captain, but only an area three metres square.
START get a magnetic flux reading there now do you?
START absorbed the memory banks, it has, captain, of them all.
START extinguished, all nonessential systems are. obey me, you will.
START stop! hurt him, you will.
START obey, i will obey. let him go.
START all right, i am, captain.
START we dealing with, what are, spock?
START the heart of the galaxy, that is, captain.
START aware of that, am i, mister spock.
START to activate auxiliary controls ready, captain.
START only be operated manually, the auxiliary warp drive controls can.
START correct, that is. activate the manual controls, you will. obey!
START to activate warp drive unit standby.
START gone is it?
START interesting. of magnetic storms in this sector no indications.
START manned by vulcans, the intrepid is, it is not?
START yes, right that is, bones.
START it, what is, spock? in pain are you?
START come on, spock, go down to sickbay, let us.
START to the sickbay get.
START no, no, no. an order, that is.
START dead, it is dead.
START it die i sensed.
START feel a starship die, not even a vulcan could.
START rendered your history a bit less bloody, might it have.
START i, filter out the distortion, cannot, sir. getting worse, it is.
START to warp three slow.
START we looking for, exactly what are, mister spock?
START assume that, i would.
START that, what is?
START businessman, i am, pally. what you say?
START since our captain back, we must have, i accept.
START you mean, going to trust him, you are?
START beginning to make sense, you now are.
START to do you know what.
START mister oxmyx, i understood we had an arrangement, truce.
START i was hoping, think that, you would, dummy.
START trying to help you, are we, oxmyx.
START sir, employing a double negative, you are.
START yeah, but to be the unity i got.
START we did, captain. our return the situation required.
START illogical would to deny the facts be, doctor.
START then you mind not if i play a hunch?
START what are we do now going to, jim?
START to be it ought. it cost a bundle.
START fliwer, captain.
START that bad, it was?
START like the trusting type they look not.
START your pardon i beg?
START going to hit somebody, you are. can i watch?
START where'd, them ears, you get?
START young man, likely to be quite hazardous, this is.
START hold on, spock. of the mouths of babes out.
START you callin' a babe who?
START calling you a babe i am.
START for me what's in it?
START what you want?
START of the action a piece.
START know what to do, you will.
START it that is. go, let us.
START what's the matter? hurt yourself did you, kid?
START my daddy i want!
START daddy! my daddy i want!
START my daddy i want.
START of the action a piece.
START see, no one can. your phaser on stun put.
START i think, got it reversed, you have, mister krako.
START i ain't, pally. your heaters put down.
START mister krako, not, i do not, er.
START you trust all your men can?
START miniscule. very small piece.
START that, how much is?
START that is, er. figure it out later we will.
START you guys had laws i thought. no interference.
START who's interfering? taking over, we are. check?
START your cut what's?
START to enterprise kirk.
START all right, scotty. with krako we made a deal.
START wise, do you think that is, sir?
START aye. indeed, i know indeed.
START rights, i got rights.
START faster than walking, it is.
START but as safe not.
START afraid of cars are you?
START not at all, captain. your driving that alarms me, it is.
START spock, got the hang of it i have. now go on.
START they, where are?
START knowing krako, probably send them back on a blotter, he will.
START to enterprise kirk.
START krako on ice, you got?
START of the phone find the man at the other end.
START what you think you are talking about i sure know not.
START with it get. giving the orders here, i am.
START advise you to keep dialing, would i, oxmyx.
START and your percentage what's?
START listen. ship, they got. i know. there, i was there.
START what, of boys a couple?
START i am going to believe my eyes not.
START over four hundred guys there, there are.
START your story, that is, buster.
START put you down, my boys will.
START i already seen it. nothing, you are, fed.
START well, all right. go ahead. get smart, do not.
START hello, scotty. kirk, this is.
START gee, some trick that is.
START hey, see that did you?
START talking about a percentage, he was.
START talking about both i was.
START reasonable, it is reasonable. reasonable, it sounds reasonable. to you that sound reasonable?
START but in all the confusion i.
START it in bela's office i think i left.
START somewhere. i am certain not.
START certain of what you are not?
START my communicator i left.
START you really think, that serious, is it?
START how you mean?
START lieutenant uhura, go, let us.
START transporter malfunction, must it be.
START rough trip, that was.
START ever seen i this is the craziest landing pad have.
START trinary sun, that is.
START to bridge scott.
START reversed controls have you?
START of you hurt either?
START i think not so, captain.
START there, captain. prepared for your training, you now are.
START how know you our names?
START expecting you, the providers were, captain. your transportation they arranged.
START of yours these providers, are they.
START correction, captain. the providers are ours not. theirs, we are theirs.
START what they want from us?
START no, doctor. even, show up on our sensors, that would.
START where then are they?
START your quarters, these are. open, thralls.
START they are within the confines of this solar system not.
START good the odds are not.
START no. say approximately four hundred, i would.
START your drill thrall, i am. called lars, am i.
START what want you from her?
START it is allowed to refuse selection not.
START interesting. to be an ionisation trail it seems.
START account for that, what would, spock?
START you, been selected for me, you have?
START very kind of you that is, miss, but.
START nourishment, it is nourishment. it that we call.
START nourishment. very practical, that is. what call you this collar?
START only to warn and punish, is it.
START how work it does he?
START permitted to talk of that it is not.
START you provide all my nourishment, will?
START that mean, what does?
START it means, a very beautiful woman, you are.
START beautiful, what is?
START born? been here always, i have.
START your parents. they, where are? your mother and father.
START killed in a freestyle match, she who bore me was.
START learn all these things, you will.
START ridiculous, this is. nothing out there, there is. nothing at all.
START to be heading into an empty sector we certainly seem.
START that, two dozen light years away, must be.
START allowed to refuse a training exercise it is not.
START do it, none of us will, galt.
START part of your training, it is. the providers wish it.
START with the providers the devil.
START pretty fast with that whip, he is.
START free people, we are. to no one we belong.
START always possible to miss something, it is.
START as a failure in the transporter mechanism such?
START no, sir. no sign of failure, there was.
START the way that is.
START their voices sound mechanical. computers are they?
START seen them, you have. bodies, have they?
START as ours not such.
START this place, what is?
START it is used not.
START bodies, they do have, or did have.
START one talks of such things not.
START very pretty country. much like my home planet very, earth.
START looked at them, have i.
START something disquieting about these creatures, there is.
START tell me you have got a feeling, do not.
START that, what is, doctor?
START them better than i like you i like.
START one redeeming characteristic, they do have.
START i know, but really.
START of course. what say did you?
START serious charge, that is. to whom referring are you?
START cyrano jones, klingon agent?
START you, i heard you.
START believe his ears he simply could not.
START against mister jones, what evidence do you have?
START yes, yes. go on. what else have do you?
START but after my grain, is he!
START any proof of that, you have?
START deny he is disrupted this station you cannot.
START of the air vents probably through one.
START plenty, if happened, what i think's happened has.
START yes, sir. get in, nothing could.
START it is working not, sir. to be stuck it seems.
START here. me try it let.
START to be gorged they seem.
START of thousands hundreds.
START assuming they got here three days ago, that is.
START he tells me now.
START dead, captain this tribble is. and these, so are.
START really, captain kirk, protest this treatment, i must.
START ah, mister jones, with an armful. few questions.
START what you want?
START those things out of here, can you get?
START in the bar, what was?
START very perceptive creatures, obviously tribbles are, captain.
START oh, yes. poisoned, it was poisoned.
START essentially it, that is.
START mister darvin, are you talk going to?
START and with it, the tribbles had nothing to do?
START you know, i think, learn to like tribbles, could i.
START well, captain, i suppose, free to go now, am i.
START twenty years in a rehabilitation colony, the penalty is.
START one thing you can do there is.
START take years, would it.
START it job security consider.
START captain, hard man, you are. all right! all right!
START do it, you will?
START do it, he will.
START do it, i will.
START captain, able to divert that freighter, starfleet was.
START and you will find a tribble on this entire ship not.
START bones, how do it did you?
START scotty! the tribbles, where are?
START oh, er, captain, really mister spock's recommendation, it was.
START well, mister scott who performed the actual engineering, it was.
START mister scott. the tribbles, where are?
START they, where are?
START to the klingons i gave them, sir.
START captain, going to like argelius i i think am.
START of good taste obviously a man.
START like her do you, scotty?
START aye. why should i not?
START scotty, scotty. they use the lights in argelius.
START of our pillows have one?
START never a word, but dying to learn, am i.
START or handsome gentleman. why not we?
START physically, all right, is he. am i right in assuming that?
START he seems, overcoming his resentment, is he.
START oh yes. i know the place. go, let us.
START dead, she is dead, jim.
START stabbed, dozen times.
START just as shocked as you are we are, mister hengist.
START you are a native of argelius not, sir?
START i, remember i not.
START really, sir. hardly helpful, that is.
START scotty, got to remember, you have.
START by any chance that scotty you think not.
START it makes not any difference what i think.
START but throw him to the wolves you just not.
START but suffering from a severe concussion, he is.
START do what we can, we will.
START love, the law of argelius is.
START and my wife, this is, sybo.
START of this you know?
START to enterprise kirk.
START as ordered lieutenant karen tracy reporting, captain.
START if just follow me, you will, lieutenant.
START of course, another possibility there is.
START ready are you, sybo?
START ready, i am ready. the knife, may i have, please?
START but it here i put when we arrived. gone, it is gone.
START dead, she is dead, jim. like the other one just.
START over and over again stabbed.
START lieutenant? captain? where is.
START dead? but i.
START be, it could be, jim. that head injury.
START locks, picked, can be, jim.
START they been during the past few minutes where've?
START captain, if please you mind not.
START been another murder, there is, hengist. of my crew one.
START as kara the same.
START please, i know nothing about it. i did kill anyone not.
START well, the girl killed, how was?
START stabbed. and no sign of the weapon, there is.
START if only, facilities, had i.
START this true is? you, who are?
START know kara did you?
START very disquieting, that is.
START often been a motive for murder, jealousy has.
START prefect, i did kill anyone not. not, i could not.
START see, we shall see, morla.
START you prove you went directly home can?
START captain, with the questions please may i continue?
START with it well get on, man. there just stand not.
START ready, i am ready, jaris.
START what you suggest, mister spock?
START normally, no, but his head could that blow on.
START unproven that is, sir.
START prove it, we can, if insane, he is insane.
START gentlemen, please. any man do such monstrous things, how could?
START what we hope to find out that is, sir.
START you, sir, to remember nothing about the murders claim.
START remain, no doubt will.
START mister scott, you take the stand, will?
START to account for periods of functional amnesia sufficient abnormalities?
START captain, how that can be i see not.
START of memory unless scotty's lying about his loss.
START all right, scotty, have it let us.
START no, captain. sure of i that am.
START scotty, to me lie. you, how old are?
START two other women murdered, there were.
START mister scott. kill kara did you?
START i not remember.
START kill lieutenant tracy did you?
START remember i not.
START waste of time, this is.
START to the entire procedure i object.
START prefect, you mean well i know, but had experience, have i.
START you at the time that kara was murdered, where were?
START i am sure not. walking home, i assume. angry, i was angry.
START kill lieutenant tracy did you?
START kill sybo did you?
START documented fact, sensitivity of certain argelian women is, captain.
START she said something else, make sense words that did not.
START computer, linguistic bank. of following word definition. redjac.
START no such word in the linguistics bank there is?
START working. affirmative. proper name.
START ridiculous, that is. of years ago he lived hundreds.
START man could survive all these centuries not.
START it feeds on death sybo said.
START computer, of such entity extrapolate most likely composition.
START affirmative. precedent, mellitus, of alpha majoris one cloud creature.
START seems likely not, does it?
START captain, aligned directly between argelius and earth, those places are.
START from rigel four, you come.
START well, many people do. it is a crime not.
START not, i will not.

START we are leaving orbit not, mister scott. not that quickly.
START nothing, sir. to scan continuing.
START change its molecular structure, are you aware it can?
START scanning for any unusual movement are you?
START of gaseous cloud any type?
START run a full scanner probe twice, we have.
START then run it twenty times if, what it takes, that is!
START disturbing you i hope i am not, doctor.
START your advice i need.
START your reasoning i understand not.
START you need advice from me? kidding must you be.
START his creature jim and?

START if delayed i had not, have been killed, it would.
START you understand, do not? it killed two hundred crewmen.
START very important to you, captain garrovick was, he was not, jim?
START blast it! forget the manual! your questions ask.
START yes, no doubt about that, there is.
START jim, we are trying to gang up on you not.
START this point at, my medical log remains open.
START in that case, gentlemen.
START all decks, red alert. red alert. to leave orbit prepare.
START spock, how read you that?
START and that sophisticated you find not, mister spock?
START extremely efficient, captain. another matter, whether that indicates intelligence is.
START to warp six go.
START i am hungry not.
START you, i told you, christine, hungry i am not.
START slowing, the creature is. down to warp two, is it.
START understand i not. outrunning us, was it.
START decided to fight, maybe it is. phasers ready?
START coming to a full halt, it is, sir. magnification one.
START captain, to return to my post request permission.
START there. coming, it is coming, sir.
START stop it the deflectors will not, captain.
START enough, that is, bones.
START mister spock, very kind of you to come here, it is.
START sir, coming through the vent, it is.
START of here get out! attempt to seal it off, i will.
START that green blood of his, is it.
START based on copper, my haemoglobin is, not iron.
START do you believe, in communication with the creature, you are?
START on the bridge, you were when we were attacked.
START very commendable, ensign. your impression of the battle, what was?
START i not understand, sir.
START firing, i delayed firing.
START understand i not, captain.
START you agree not with mister spock?
START our only possibility antimatter seems.
START still one problem, there is, captain.
START have to take we a chance will, mister spock.
START exactly why i have decided to set the trap myself, that is.
START require two men to transport the antimatter unit, will it.
START like permission to go with you i would, sir.
START you in mind, had i, mister garrovick.
START to enterprise kirk.
START to maximum orbit proceed immediately.
START to enterprise kirk.
START yes, sir. the cause of the affliction, we have.
START it, what is?
START oh, mister sulu. to twenty thousand mile perigee increase orbit.
START mister sulu, our present position, what is?
START i am a magician not, spock, just an old country doctor.
START spock, word with you, i can have?
START aware of that, i am.
START sir, duties to perform, i do have.
START going to hurt a bit now this is not.
START what you said the last time, that is.
START hurt did it?
START we got, how long have, bones?
START oh, of days a matter. perhaps hours.
START it also read that i consider it invalid let.
START of you very kind, spock.
START mister sulu, how long served with captain kirk have you?
START not did he, several minutes later, repeat that order?
START order you to increase orbit did he?
START several minutes later repeat that order did he not?
START mister sulu, answer the question.
START yes, sir. his order captain kirk repeated.
START sir, more important things on his mind, he had.
START yeoman, simply answer the question, you will.
START i, signed it, i guess he forgot he would.
START forgot he would signed it, would he.
START and those, whose initials are which appear directly below yours?
START of captain kirk those.
START oh, yes, but to code three he changed it.
START no, thirty four, i am. thirty four years old, i am.
START with you the computer differs, captain.
START his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly is not?
START yes, yes, but better man right now, is he.
START agree with it do you, doctor?
START yes. yes, i do, agree. and sorry, i am sorry, jim.
START no. quite satisfied i am, mister spock.
START wish to call any witnesses do you, captain kirk?
START captain, suggest, i would suggest.
START yes. of the tongue a slip.
START no more questions, have we, captain.
START me anything ask. anything.
START sir, never commanded a starship, you have.
START the danger from the romulans.
START so, been relieved i have.
START sorry, i am sorry, captain.
START yes. you, been a prosecuting attorney, should have.
START captain, i have assumed command not.
START as you i suffer the same affliction, sir.
START if in command you are not, who is?
START stocker? crazy are you? never had a field command, he is.
START refusing a direct order are you?
START oh, jim. sorry, i am sorry. truly i am.
START what doing here are you?
START like to relieve doctor mccoy, you maybe would. what about chekov?
START yes. yes, indeed, captain. doctor, you remember.
START doctor, the specific accepted for all radiation sickness, hyronalin is.
START romulans approaching from both sides. bracketed, we are bracketed, sir.
START going up to the bridge i am.
START no, jim. do it, you cannot.
START to go to the bridge, i have. under attack, we are.
START me go let.
START to raise the romulans keep trying.
START trying, i am trying, commodore.
START listening to explanations the romulans are notorious for not.
START right, lieutenant uhura is, sir. tangled with them before we have.
START greenhorn, my ship up there ruining.
START jim, if to give you a shot, i have.
START all right. let us, go, let us.
START cure or kill, could it, doctor.
START no. take the first shot i will.
START jim, kill you, it could.
START die anyway i will. do it.
START sir, fired another, they have.
START well then, no alternative but to surrender, have we.
START sir, the romulans take not captives.
START losing power, we are, sir.
START but, captain, code.
START an order, that is, lieutenant. code two.
START logical assumption, mister spock. still retreating are they?
START caught off guard, the romulans were, captain. falling behind, they are.
START of range are we out, mister sulu?
START yes, sir. and of the neutral zone out.
START looking good, you are, doc.
START quite ready now, i am, doctor.
START very considerate of you, that is, doctor.
START i thought pleased to hear that you would be.
START as she goes steady, captain.
START in addition, of swords and knives an assortment.
START you stationed on the planet, how long were, doctor?
START aye, sir. keep on our toes, will we.
START halt! of the earth vessel, you are?
START captain kirk, am i.
START with open hearts and hands, we come.
START move a muscle, do not.
START or your policy to kill klingons on sight is it?
START young, he was young, and inexperienced.
START me call my ship and inform them let.
START you hand us your weapons, will?
START yes, that, i mentioned that.
START he also mentioned that they, highly dangerous, can be.
START well, put it on the screen, let us.
START klingon ship, you think it is?
START have chewed you out i should not. sorry, i am sorry.
START yes, quite right, you are, mister spock. inefficient and illogical.
START appear, it would appear, captain, you a disappointment that he finds.
START different, their customs are, teer.
START laughter, teer? is the klingon an honoured guest also not?
START i who speak for the tribe, it is, maab.
START do you say, fight me, you will, maab?
START your choice let that be, teer.
START the ship's disappeared, sir. of range gone out.
START of vessel type. location.
START dierdre? freighter, that is.
START it up picking, sir. taking a fix.
START you carry a child who, teer, would be.
START die, i must die.
START of a teer no man may touch the wife.
START prepared to die, was she, earthman.
START to mister spock enterprise. doctor mccoy, come in please.
START to take us out of orbit prepare, mister sulu.
START seem a logical conclusion, that would.
START very good idea, that is, bones.
START me see that arm let.
START touch me you will not.
START always desirable, to live is.
START all right. go let us.
START klingon. nothing to concern you there, there is.
START be on our screens by now, it should.
START at best, freighter might travel warp two.
START well aware of a freighter's maximum speed, i am, mister sulu.
START with her stay, bones. to get trapped in nice place.
START but defensible entrance, captain.
START you will touch me in that manner not.
START as i thought just. come anytime now, can it.
START how you know?
START because doctor, i am, how i know, that is.
START enough loose rock and shale there is.
START only a very slight chance, work, would it.
START captain, say that exactly i did not.
START well, if you think not you can handle it.
START need help getting her in there, i will.
START no! allow only your touch, will i.
START vessel justs not disappear.
START nothing, there is, mister scott. clear, all channels and frequencies are.
START they normally call for the nearest starship would not?
START trap. diverted from the planet, we were.
START or an authentic distress call could it be.
START stay long enough to make certain, we will. continue search pattern.
START no, no. here, pain is.
START in mine from now on, is it.
START no, no. there, it is there. there, the the pain is.
START vegetation, captain. water nearby, evidently there is.
START seem to be little weapon potential at hand, there would.
START easy, easy. here, i am here. want the child, now you must!
START no. here, to husband child belongs.
START yes, yours, it is yours.
START no, no. got it all wrong, you have.
START yes, mccoy. yours, it is yours.
START to enterprise kirk. come in. to enterprise kirk. come in.
START fortunately, suitable tensile cohesion, this bark has.
START rather, i would rather, rather not, i would. thank you.
START mccoy. our child bring.
START explain later, will i.
START prove very interesting, that should.
START turning back, we are. warp five, helm.
START warp five, sir. for capella four on course.
START registered in this sector, the carolina is.
START ignore it, lieutenant. as my order log it, my responsibility.
START scotty, if turn out to be real, it should.
START me with a rock my patient spattered. gone, she is gone.
START go with you i will.
START to planet estimating?
START drawing a line, to step over it daring us.
START still closing. of flight the alien's directly in our line.
START ready, phaser banks are, sir.
START the earthmen make excellent game. surprised me, their cleverness has.
START dead. as they slept i killed them.
START if true, to them take us.
START first, verify her story, we will.
START this what your sworn word means is, klingon?
START just one thing i want, there is.
START get him, one of us must.
START it there hold. your weapons drop.
START you, we missed you, mister scott.
START well, at any rate, prove interesting, this should.
START understand it ourselves we actually not, mister scott.
START doctor mccoy, nor does.
START named leonard james akaar, the child was?
START that vulcan salute go, how does?
START with your presence vulcan honours us. to serve, we come.
START doctor. my wife, my aides and she who is.
START prefer another guide, i would, captain.
START captain, my parents, ambassador sarek and his wife are.
START with so little provocation humans smile.
START the situation between my father and myself has changed not.
START mister spock. moment, if you please.
START mrs. sarek, understand i just not.
START amanda. i am afraid you could pronounce the vulcan name not.
START like a command it sounded more.
START of course. vulcan, he is. his wife, i am.
START and his son, spock is.
START my best officer, spock is, and my friend.
START both stubborn, they are.
START human trait, captain?
START no! you! how you vote, of vulcan sarek?
START for reasons tellarites argue not. argue, they simply argue.
START correct, you are, captain. quite logical.
START met gav before have you, ambassador?
START my last council session we debated during. ambassador.
START sort of a fat teddy bear, it is.
START teddy bear?
START teddy bear.
START answer a hail does she?
START this quadrant except ours starfleet records no authorised vessel in.
START to guess what she is care?
START guess, captain? for my estimate i shall need more data.
START also human, he is.
START starfleet officer, he is.
START i thought you did approve of starfleet not.
START interesting. travelling at approximately warp ten, they were.
START vulcan, speak to you, i would.
START seem unavoidable, it does.
START how vote you on the coridan admission?
START well for you, that is. no mining interest, vulcan has.
START been carrying coridan dilithium crystals, some of your ships have.
START understood. payment for your slander, there will be, sarek.
START illogical, threats are. and usually expensive, payment is.
START to captain kirk security.
START he killed, how was?
START broken, his neck was. by an expert.
START who aboard, that knowledge, would have?
START vulcans approve not of violence.
START have done it you are saying he could not?
START of me you want something, captain?
START ambassador, the tellarite. been murdered, gav has.
START yes. ambassador, you during the past hour, where were?
START captain, accusing him you are not?
START agree, i quite agree.
START then you during the hour, where were?
START very convenient excuse, that is, ambassador.
START you help him can?
START that yet either i know not.
START sorry about your father i am.
START yes, adversely affect our mission, it could.
START are you worried about him not?
START i think it unlikely, one of theirs, is it.
START the intruder ship, it is, sir.
START to mister spock's station for decode switch recorder, lieutenant.
START possibly, captain. but decode this transmission, i cannot.
START bones, he, how is?
START you tell me why did not?
START done could there was nothing you have.
START ambassador, when these attacks, you did have?
START no witnesses, there were?
START doctor, propose surgery for the heart defect do you?
START because of the vulcan heart of the construction.
START other vulcans aboard, there are.
START yes, say that is rare, i would.
START be possible to filter out the human factors, it should.
START indeed. estimate the odds, i would.
START it, i see it, spock, but rigelian, that was.
START very similar to vulcan, rigelian physiology is.
START good enough similar is not. still experimental, is it.
START but look promising, it does.
START what drug, doctor? asleep, my husband is. what drug?
START already pulled. perfectly healthy, you are, mister spock.
START that got, what has.
START seem the only answer, it would.
START in the brig questioning the andorian prisoner, i will be.
START turn command over to scotty, you can.
START spock, turn command over to somebody else, you must.
START duty? to your father, your duty is.
START as important as your father's life, nothing is.
START oh, to him go. now. please.
START no, my head the one inside. i, how long have.
START not good. if only operate, could i.
START what's stopping you? all ready, i thought you were.
START jim, if you stand, start to bleed again, you could.
START captain, quite all right are you?
START get out, spock. chekov, of the intruder what's the status?
START to the bridge call mister scott.
START captain, moving closer, the alien vessel is.
START belay that order. stay here, i will.
START security? to the brig security. search the prisoner immediately.
START going, where do you think you are?
START see the captain, i must.
START so your father's life is.
START moving away. turning now. coming around again, he is.
START as he passes fire, ensign.
START clean miss, sir.
START his weaponry report on, mister chekov.
START coming around again, he is.
START full spread missed, sir. moving too fast for us, they are.
START off, the systems are.
START sickbay systems put on priority, call engineering and have.
START buckled, number four shield has, sir.
START intended from the beginning, that was, captain.
START andorian you are not. you, who are?
START gone, number two shield is.
START your own answers find, captain. long to live you have not.
START what doing are you?
START no. your phasers stand by, mister chekov.
START looking us over. dead as far as he knows, are we.
START baiting him, you are. trying to lure him in, you are.
START he comes here. range decreasing. to sublight speed dropping close.
START your fire hold, mister chekov.
START to sickbay take him.
START miscalculated, i seem to have.
START quite through shaking the ship around are you?
START spock, they, sarek how are?
START all the luck, some doctors have.
START captain, i believe, find the alien, you will.
START i think, find he is an orion, you will, doctor.
START but they gain by an attack on starfleet, what would?
START had something else on your mind, you might have.
START no, but you anyway thank.
START i not understand.
START for your life saving.
START emotional, she is not?
START always been that way, she has.
START indeed? why marry her did you?
START at the time, to do it seemed the logical thing.
START doctor, return to my station now, i will.
START at your station, you are, mister spock.
START doctor mccoy, i believe, enjoying all this, you are.
START indeed, captain. never seen him look so happy, i have.
START she, how is, doc?
START to the starfleet small thanks.
START now really, commissioner, you, blame the starfleet, cannot.
START i, received the proper inoculations ahead of time, should have.
START you check your automatic scanner, will, please?
START odd, that is. never seen anything like that before, have i.
START i, nor have.
START with us staying right. sensor readings, mister spock.
START got it, have we.
START helm answers not, captain.
START what's happening? to know i demand.
START your scheduled rendezvous with the enterprise, i insist you make.
START to stay inside just how long am i supposed, captain?
START there, a reason, must be.
START look a little further, let us.
START bones, get a physiological reading on that, it is whatever.
START real enough, are we.
START vulcan, you are, you are not?
START human, he is human, jim. everything checks out perfectly.
START well, know anything about that i would not.
START you mind not if we continue to try?
START go right ahead. got plenty of time, you have.
START what about you, cochrane? how get here did you?
START to notice i needed one how perceptive of you.
START talks a lot, but he says not much.
START noticed something else i have.
START familiar, he looks familiar.
START familiar? you mention it now that, he does.
START quite place him, i cannot, but. what about miss hedford?
START you keep it so terribly hot in here must?
START feel hot do you?
START infuriated, i feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged.
START rest later, will i, doctor.
START yes, i know. running out of time, it means we are.
START that, what was?
START nothing to explain, there is.
START all right. the companion, was it.
START injured, you were?
START dying, i was dying, mister spock.
START you seem perfectly all right now. the matter, what was?
START an old man i was.
START what, you were?
START pretty far out story, that is.
START mister cochrane, first name, do you have?
START right that is, captain.
START is your story a little improbable not, mister cochrane?
START true, never found, his body was.
START looking at it, you are, mister spock.
START how you feel?
START terrible. i feel, how should?
START running a little temperature, you are. lie down, perhaps you should.
START we have, how long do?
START of hours a matter, all that is.
START aged i have not. to that the companion sees.
START know, i already know.
START mind telling us you would not?
START like it you will not.
START i already like not it.
START here to keep me company, you are.
START you brought us here you mean?
START begin to age again, i would, normally.
START do you leave here want to?
START got it, you have.
START i said, very powerful, was it.
START it cure her could?
START know i not.
START how communicate you with it?
START how do you it?
START of clear my mind and it comes i just sort.
START bones, what make you of that?
START of some kind almost a symbiosis, of joining a sort.
START no, more than that, it is.
START agreed. like love more.
START all right are you?
START the companion, do anything to help miss hedford, cannot.
START then die, she will die.
START spock! all right are you?
START you, it attacked you?
START you, it troubles you, cochrane?
START also keeping you prisoner, it is.
START it killed i want not.
START it powerless we may simply render.
START of view i suppose from your point, right, you are.
START all right. to contact it you want me?
START it ours nor.
START that, what kind of talk is?
START it is your fault not.
START for use with more congruent life forms, the translator is.
START of residual matter floating around there'd still be traces, lieutenant.
START as she goes steady, mister sulu.
START what think you it means, mister scott?
START this course we stay on, see what comes up.
START big galaxy, it is, mister scott.
START this device what's the theory behind?
START yes. change the entire situation, the matter of gender could.
START way ahead of you, i am.
START then it is a zookeeper not.
START but i heard.
START understand i not.
START error when contacting http://www.yodaspeak.co.uk/index.php
START what complaining about are you? you alive it kept.
START that thing fed on me. me, it used me. disgusting, it is disgusting.
START as bad as it is, you are.
START fascinating. totally parochial attitude.
START him, i heard him. loved and he resents it, was he.
START companion, love the man do you?
START understand i not.
START part of me, he is. continue, the man must.
START he ages not. forever, he remains forever.
START understand i not.
START what hope to gain by that did you, jim?
START useless, it is useless. i know.
START i understand not it. sick at all she is not.
START you understand, do not? the companion, it is.
START here, we are here.
START companion, you have not the power to create life.
START for the maker of all things that is.
START dying, commissioner hedford was.
START then both here, you are, in the one body?
START one, we are one.
START letting us go, you are?
START very beautiful, you are.
START explain many things, could i.
START go ahead, few things to do we cochrane have.
START mister scott, the captain, it is.
START perfectly all right. can, a fix on us, you get.
START computing your position now, the helm is, captain.
START go with you, i cannot, zefram.
START of course you can. to, you have.
START of this hour the joy. pleased, i am pleased.
START well, i, just fly away and leave you here, cannot.
START free, must you be, zefram cochrane.
START waiting, the enterprise is, mister cochrane.
START honours enough, have i.
START sure are you?
START captain, tell them about me, do not.
START specifics, doctor. labels make not arguments.
START with gaping defects in logic i find your argument strewn.
START i cannot, sir.
START sir, on total override, auxiliary control is.
START to security kirk.
START lieutenant uhura, to the bridge have mister spock report.
START of the intruder any sign?
START sir, the instruments will respond not.
START emergency manual monitor, the captain, this is. report.
START here, allowed you are not.
START to engineering kirk.
START scotty, in your area, the intruder is.
START captain, here, he is here.
START i cannot, sir. jammed, all the controls are.
START it will be necessary not, captain.
START you, who are?
START you require? we, who and what are?
START i am programmed to respond in that area not.
START it seems, going to take a little trip, are we.
START any meetings or discussions, held aboard the enterprise, can be.
START gracious invitation, i must say that is.
START and that word, what is?
START it i believe not.
START welcome aboard, kirk. been a long time, it is, eh?
START well, i am afraid, a bit of a problem there, there is.
START to enterprise kirk.
START to enterprise kirk.
START this man you know, captain?
START oh, know him, do i. harcourt fenton mudd, thief.
START swindler and con man.
START leave you with that impression, did i?
START that, i shall do, kirk, when ready, i am ready.
START telling you now, am i.
START all right, listen, i will listen. what telling are you?
START of the same model five hundred? that seems rather redundant.
START pay royalties to the owners of those patents did you?
START he did pay royalties not.
START knowledge, sir, to all should be free.
START you know how'd?
START that is what, have done, would i.
START jail, he broke jail.
START transportation, i borrowed transportation.
START go on, with it get on, harry.
START then unable to discern your problem, i am.
START not, i think not, harry.
START of them what became?
START then of your makers survive some.
START no, captain. of time they died over the stretch.
START whom serve now do you?
START free to visit them, you are.
START we leave you, why should?
START in much trouble, i think we are.
START great help, that is, mister chekov. bones?
START enjoying yourself, i trust you are, mister spock.
START very interesting. very interesting. most unusual device, this is.
START our central control complex, it is.
START oh, quite understandable, that is.
START say so, i should.
START say, i must say, the styling i like.
START you believe in male androids, do not, harry?
START male? well, i suppose, their uses, have they.
START body like that last, how long does?
START so glad you enjoyed it, i am, doctor.
START lose your head, do not, bones. nobody's staying anywhere.
START be bored i would not, tell you that, i can.
START splendid. splendid. to mudd welcome, mister scott.
START scotty, ordered to stay aboard, you were.
START what mean does she, the last one?
START harry, harry, never get away with it, you will.
START well, to stop me who's?
START i am trying to not.
START and alice, you are.
START oh, well, it makes much difference not. both lovely, you are.
START real what a shame you are not.
START even better than leningrad, this place is.
START and very pleasant place, it is, captain.
START what offer you did they, uhura?
START but unhappy here, are we.
START no, beautiful lady, it is, and her, we love her.
START mudd, few questions i ask you want to.
START no longer take your orders, we can, harry mudd.
START wise, our makers were. to serve they programmed us.
START harry, i think, something else in mind, have they.
START take care of them we shall.
START your kind the whole galaxy controlled by?
START how know you so much?
START them, i asked them.
START all right, we got to work with, what have?
START i agree. direct them, what in your opinion does?
START seem logical, that would.
START i do, what can?
START nothing, harry. to sleep just go.
START oh, harry. i do believe, putting on weight, you are.
START dying, he is dying.
START uhura, why tell her did you?
START it myself i half believed.
START next, take the alices on a trip through wonderland we.
START their captivity. enjoy the music do you?
START better, that is, mister chekov.
START illogical, your statement is.
START how look does it?
START completely inner directed. to everything oblivious.
START you, i love you. however, you, i hate you.
START what doing here are you?
START to surrender i want you.
START our burdens dying and crying and lamenting over.
START we be happy, only this way can.
START contradictory, that is. logical it is not. mister spock. explain.
START have killed him you cannot. no weapons, you have.
START how like it did you?
START irrational, that is. illogical. dreams are real not.
START panic, do not. women and children first.
START be careful. want you to drop it i would not.
START easy now. oh, caught it, is he!
START no explosive, there is.
START all right are you?
START but no explosion, there was.
START to this carefully listen, norman. lying, i am lying.
START i am programmed to respond in that area not.
START all immobilised, i believe they are, captain.
START partnership arrangement? you and me?
START got something else in mind, i have. go, let us.
START well, very unhappy must you be, mister spock.
START but what i do? kirk, no scientist, i am.
START of you i call that unexpectedly civil, captain.
START you, i order you. shut up, stella!
START kirk, do this, you cannot.
START one? jackson, scott and sulu, where are?
START sorry, i am sorry. i, clear it, cannot, captain.
START dead, the man is.
START odd. indicate fog our probe data did not.
START to enterprise kirk.
START the ship's sensors reading now, what are, lieutenant?
START lieutenant, you hear me can?
START listen. now, what think you that.
START you, who are?
START more useful comment, mister spock.
START real what we have just seen is not.
START where we are going, that is.
START pretty real illusion, that was, mister spock.
START to enterprise kirk. enterprise, come in.
START and it picks up on our ship's sensors not.
START our sensors register the life forms inside, nor do.
START then affect spock's tricorder too, would it, it would not?
START seem to be in order, that would.
START for malfunctions check.
START i did, sir, as as it happened soon.
START do it i can, sir. i am that green not.
START down there, we know they are. i want them found.
START so indicate, the readings would.
START dust, cobwebs. right, halloween is.
START spock. all right are you?
START yes. undamaged, i am undamaged, captain.
START saying something about trick or treat, you were.
START of some sort could this be an earth parallel development?
START ghost stories, ogres, demons. the whole.
START he collapsed neither did jackson just before.
START going to release us, they are.
START you, who are? why bring us here did you?
START ancient earth legends about wizards and their familiars, there are.
START he knows not about trick or treat.
START hungry we are not.
START all right, korob. what want you from us?
START change that attitude i hopefully can.
START valueless? i not understand. i read.
START think a man to death you cannot.
START do not. sylvia, do not.
START to enterprise kirk. come in. come in.
START the temperature, sir. rising, it keeps rising. reading, mister.
START desalle, your heat dissipation units channel bypass power into.
START relax now, you can, captain. safe, your ship is.
START almost back to normal, temperature is, dropping down fast.
START lieutenant, to raise the captain again try.
START you name it, what would, captain?
START yes, change the molecular structure, we can.
START oh, we did have to know not. they knew.
START nothing to discuss, have we.
START it will analyse not, sir.
START how long been has it?
START thanks. i wonder what, doing to doc, are they.
START to tap our conscious mind they tried.
START sent here for, you forget what we were.
START nothing, i forget nothing. puppet i am not, korob, like you.
START traitor, you are.
START duty to the old ones we have.
START cruel, you are. you torture our specimens.
START wrong, you are! discarding everything we live by, you are.
START the power, i have.
START this is ended not, sylvia.
START you call not that damage?
START i, why should?
START to need us you seem. why?
START very persuasive, you are. what happens if i go along?
START your people, when here, they come here.
START like, they are like, like feathers in the wind without the transmuter.
START then device, it is. use tools, you do.
START it gives only form. teaching me substance, you are.
START you have changed your mind not? return home you will not?
START and why not? been using me and my crew, you have.
START any change i see not.
START there, it is there, lieutenant.
START leaving without my men i am not.
START transmuter. yes, that, she mentioned that.
START i think, stop her, can i.
START my problem, it is. one of my kind, she is. come quickly.
START do you think, make it, you can?
START korob, last that door will not.
START captain, bit more alacrity, if you please.
START let her touch the wand, do not, captain.
START you get tired of these games, do not?
START never played games, i have. to me give it.
START take some explaining that'll, bones.
START too late. of this all, just an illusion.
START no illusion. dead, jackson is. to enterprise kirk. come in.
START to beam up five.
START you pinpoint it any closer can, lieutenant?
START sir, picking up a ship's disaster beacon, i am.
START to raise it try, lieutenant.
START no answer, captain. is the automatic beacon, all i get.
START sensors recording normal energy output not.
START the constellation, it is. look at that.
START red alert. red alert. your battle stations man.
START going to board her, are we. mister spock, in command, you are.
START out, filtration systems are, sir.
START what think you did it, sir?
START abducted the crew was not, left, they just left. to enterprise kirk.
START continue our search, we will. kirk out.
START exhausted. give up without a battle they did not.
START matt. matt, jim kirk, it is.
START kirk. jim kirk, it is.
START to your ship what happened, matt?
START ship. attacked. that, that thing.
START what thing? it, what was?
START answer me! it, what was? what happened, matt?
START with the duplicate log ready, sir.
START to your crew what happened?
START matt, your crew, where is?
START no third planet, there is.
START captain, our report, washburn has.
START what look like does it?
START both or neither. i not know.
START to raise starfleet command due to heavy subspace interference unable.
START robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. why?
START we not know. an alien race, apparently from another galaxy.
START bones, ever hear of a doomsday machine did you?
START no. doctor, i am, not a mechanic.
START oh, no, here, i stay here. leaving my ship i am not!
START closing on us, it is, mister spock.
START to beam ready, sir.
START mister spock, communication's damaged. unable to override interference, are we.
START i, repair warp drive without a spacedock, cannot.
START no casualties, mister spock. we doing, how are?
START outrun it, we have, doctor.
START carry out my last order, you will, mister sulu.
START destroyed, that thing must be.
START let him do this, you cannot, spock.
START doctor, out of line, you are.
START certify that right now, will i.
START then be considered valid your statement would not.
START what about the captain? leave, we cannot leave.
START captain, fused solid, the impulse engines' control circuits are.
START helmsman, your course hold. stand by all phaser banks.
START to give it a try ready?
START scotty, you doing how?
START it now try, captain.
START washburn, to engineering get down. assist mister scott.
START but you understand, do not? got to destroy it, we have!
START break loose, we cannot!
START got it we have not. being pulled inside, we are.
START scotty, me that power give.
START it, that is, mister scott. keep that power coming.
START aye, sir. we still, move, cannot.
START it on keep pouring, scotty.
START captain, i still know not what we are doing.
START phasers? got 'em, you have. one bank recharged i have.
START loose, we are loose, commodore.
START closing fast on the constellation, it is.
START commodore, i suggest.
START moving away, we are, commodore.
START closing with us again, is it, sir.
START mister spock, pierced the interference locally, we have.
START you raise starfleet can?
START matt. what's going on? me mister spock give.
START in command here, i am, jim.
START nothing. to regulations i assumed command according.
START speaking to a senior officer, you are, kirk.
START me spock give.
START to repair warp drive how long?
START gaining on us, it is, sir.
START mister spock, relieve commodore decker immediately. direct order, that is.
START commodore decker, relieved of command, you are.
START i recognise not your authority to relieve me.
START captain, assumed command i have.
START accompany the commodore to sickbay, you will.
START fine. of it just make sure you stay ahead.
START it going keep, scotty, it going keep. mister spock.
START too late, it is, sir.
START to enterprise kirk. why launching a shuttlecraft are you?
START to shuttlecraft enterprise. come in, shuttlecraft.
START to enterprise shuttlecraft. decker here.
START commodore, insist that you return to the ship, i must.
START kirk, this is. matt, killed, will you be.
START stronger with you than without you, are we!
START gone, he is gone. constellation, come in, please.
START regrettable that he died for nothing, is it.
START mister spock, now operational, the transporter is.
START transporter operational, captain. beam you aboard shall we?
START little to be gained by staying aboard the constellation there is.
START insufficient data. to take further sensor readings i shall try.
START spock, you not know?
START captain, getting dangerously close to the planet killer, you are.
START jim, killed, will you be, like decker just.
START calculated risk, mister spock.
START very slim timing, thirty seconds is.
START have to take, a chance i will. kirk out.
START understood. mister spock. to beam scotty on board prepare.
START with that thing what's the matter?
START power drain somewhere, is it, sir. i almost lost you.
START out, transporter is, captain. have to stand by, you will.
START i cannot. power level's dropping too fast. better hurry, you would.
START to beam me aboard on my signal prepare.
START me aboard beam.
START energising. bridge, shorted out again, it is.
START och, with it what's wrong?
START gentlemen, me aboard beam.
START mister scott, to detonation twenty seconds.
START sixty, fifty, forty.
START gentlemen, me aboard i suggest you beam.
START her now try, mister kyle.
START bridge, him through, we got!
START your readings start.
START spectacular, it is spectacular, it is not?
START shame to have to intrude, it is.
START sure about that are you?
START me homesick it makes. like russia just.
START of eden more like the garden, ensign.
START what did somebody say? like this that paradise must've looked?
START aye, captain. shame about hendorff, is it.
START it, what is?
START but you say, nothing to worry about, there is?
START well, sir, exactly say that i did not.
START i hear, nice down there, is it.
START indeed. for miles in all directions subsurface vibrations.
START it, what is?
START it, what is, mister spock?
START about to take some readings i was.
START it is whatever, like a cat it moves.
START jim, this i like not.
START of eden garden, with land mines.
START to captain kirk enterprise.
START stop it i could not, but why, i know why.
START heading there now, are we, scotty. you need any help?
START nothing you can do about it, there is, sir.
START of generator some kind?
START to find in paradise peculiar stuff.
START to enterprise kirk.
START spock. all right are you?
START just what you think you were trying to do?
START unaware of that plant, i surmised you were, so i.
START so, i shall do.
START one hundred twenty two thousand two hundred.
START thirty seconds ago, there was a cloud in the sky not.
START over there, it is! that way! i never saw anything like.
START jim, you could have stopped any of this not.
START me get into the academy his father helped.
START captain. in each case, unavoidable, this was.
START prevented all of it, could i have.
START i see not how.
START mister chekov, totally inefficient, your tricorder readings are!
START what you want, violence?
START the eyes of vaal, i am. see, he must see.
START vaal, who is?
START vaal, vaal is. everything, he is everything.
START name, do you have?
START captain, fascinating, this is. if permit me, you will, sir?
START of the people of vaal you speak. nearby are they?
START to captain kirk enterprise.
START aye, sir. all, is impulse power, have we.
START it on maximum put. full emergency circuits.
START all on, they are, captain.
START no, sir. slipping, we are slipping.
START i will do everything, to do, there is, sir. scott out.
START me about vaal tell.
START to him take me. to speak to him i wish.
START take my chances, i will.
START but the centre this is not, mister spock.
START force field?
START akuta, how talk you to vaal?
START when get hungry does he?
START the people of vaal, these are.
START the others, where are?
START no others, there are.
START children? to me you use unknown words.
START like yourselves little ones. they grow.
START replacements. necessary, none are. forbidden by vaal, are they.
START love. strange words. children. love. love, what is?
START love is when two people are.
START ah, yes. the holding, the touching. forbidden this, vaal has.
START to vaal welcome.
START well, thank you. something for you, it does.
START yes, it does indeed, captain. me uncomfortable it makes.
START sayana, i am sayana. name, you have?
START yes. spock. spock, i am spock.
START to see what they find so amusing i fail.
START nothing makes sense down here. to enterprise kirk.
START sir, doing everything within engineering reason, we are.
START that is the way not.
START my view in, of reciprocity a splendid example.
START maintain did it, scotty?
START cutting it a bit fine, that is, scotty.
START yeoman, wasting energy, you are.
START captain, trapped, we are trapped,
START sit down, and to eat have something.
START up there, the enterprise is.
START need a replacement, would they. opinion, mister spock?
START from a machine? that, like to see, would i.
START i understand, vaal. it, done, shall be.
START any place we, together is paradise, can be.
START i not know.
START we be able to get back aboard, will?
START no, not if, with me, you are.
START why look you like that?
START they touched the way. understand i not.
START pleasant, it is pleasant, makora.
START yes. this way they touched in.
START vaal! angry, he is angry.
START kill, akuta? we not understand.
START it going how's, scotty?
START that, i know that. as you said, cutting things fine that is.
START kirk out. it, what is?
START disturbing. disappeared, the people of vaal seem to have.
START get out of here, let us!
START second degree burns. not serious, but bet they smart, will i.
START doctor, an unsurpassed talent for understatement, you have.
START captain, doing it, we are. pulling away, we are!
START no good, it is, sir. only a few systems responding, there is.
START fired, you are. four hundred people.
START to ring the dinner bell fine time.
START scotty, still have phaser power do you?
START aye, but what.
START aye, sir, but penetrate that force field they will not.
START assume so, i would.
START good. see how long he can do it, let us.
START no power generation at all, captain. dead, vaal is.
START tractor beam gone. to antimatter pods potency returning.
START children, what are?
START i agree not with you at all, mister spock.
START that is unusual not, doctor.
START jim, to hear this i want you.
START captain, aware of the biblical story of genesis, you are.
START no, mister spock. i did think you would be not.
START to beam up landing party stand by.
START but not, we will not. consider that. enterprise. transporter room, energise.
START responsible for stopping the ship are you?
START it back give, then talk, we will talk.
START all right! doing, you whatever are, it off turn! you win!
START gone, pressure is, captain. space normal on hull.
START go, let us, bones. you in good voice?
START sure, wise, is it, jim?
START verbose, he is not?
START present, insults are effective only where emotion is.
START going to need help in all those areas, are we.
START of earth you know? been there, you have?
START and the tsar of all the russias, i am.
START sorry, i am sorry, captain. i never met a god before.
START and you have yet not. readings, doctor.
START so simple evidently not.
START leave this place you will not.
START permit that device to work i will not, either, captain.
START what you want is it?
START worship me, you will, as your fathers did before you.
START i said, worship me, you would.
START and got a lot to learn, you have!
START to break through it try, lieutenant.
START analysis. lieutenant palamas, what know you about apollo?
START he is whatever, to control a remarkable technology he seems.
START bones, i wonder if five thousand years ago.
START theory, you have?
START an idea, i have. what if, really apollo, is he?
START your name i mean.
START her alone leave.
START and you, so do.
START grown weary of discussion and argument i have.
START captain, the phasers. fused, all the working parts are.
START oh, beautiful, it is beautiful.
START going with you she is not.
START all right, is it, captain. go, i will go.
START without fear. fit indeed, is she.
START bones, he, how is?
START have been rather difficult to stop, he would.
START mister chekov, i think, better continue your investigation, you would.
START how you feel, scotty?
START seem so, would it.
START able, i am able, sir.
START scotty believes not in gods.
START to reverse polarity ready, mister sulu?
START to generate computed and standing by, sir.
START working, i am working, sir, but do anything with this i cannot.
START just picked up readings for our own people i have, sir.
START seem to pinpoint it, i cannot.
START oh, lovely, it is lovely.
START you really think, a god, you are?
START but you said the others did die not.
START understand i not.
START this boy spock's contaminating, jim.
START seem most likely that would, sir.
START to do number one on our list of things.
START is that all, to offer, you have?
START bones, possible is it.
START lieutenant palamas, where is?
START no longer of any concern to you, she is.
START you bloodthirsty saracen, you done with her, what have?
START learn discipline, you will. learn, you will.
START chekov, me a hand give.
START all right are you, captain?
START like the cat in that russian story he disappeared again.
START you mean the english story, do not, the cheshire cat?
START cheshire? no, sir. minsk perhaps, but.
START how you feel?
START get my arm to move i cannot.
START got to get out of here we have.
START get us killed, i still say it can.
START essential, speed is, lieutenant.
START go! gather laurel leaves? you, joking, must be!
START kill a deer. the funniest thing i ever heard that is.
START of your insolence you shall reap the rewards!
START tired of your phony fireworks, are we!
START mortal, earned this, you have!
START they worship you if you hurt them, how can?
START captain, got to do something, we have!
START carolyn. to her what's happened?
START scotty, find out, i will.
START you, how old are?
START over there come. well?
START understand i not.
START spurn him. reject him. you must. special to him, you are.
START yes. him, i love him.
START yes. yes, i understand. calling me, is he.
START lieutenant. your orders and your duty, you have.
START yes, sir. my duty my orders and.
START of some sort near you is there a structure?
START indeed, there is, mister spock.
START very good. how doing on the force field are you?
START captain. recommend a discreet distance, i would.
START well, it serves any other purpose i know of not.
START yes, i know. i know. scotty. wait, we will wait.
START apollo, i am apollo. chosen you, i have.
START i believe not it. you love me.
START that, what the devil is?
START picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area, sensors are.
START captain, got to go and find her we have!
START got to be here, have we when he comes back.
START but not, what if he does. what if he.
START fire those phasers! an order, that is, mister spock!
START to the shields more power.
START had to do this i wish we had not.
START spock, it is spock. noticed anything strange about him have you?
START no, nothing in particular. why?
START all right, it is. carry on, miss chapel.
START bones, busy man, am i.
START spock, this all about, what the devil is?
START all right, spock, have it, let us.
START captain, surely, enough leave time accumulated, have i.
START no. of that nature nothing, captain.
START spock, asking you, i am. what's wrong?
START rest, i need rest. asking you to accept that answer i am.
START to vulcan alter course. to warp four increase speed.
START over here put it on audio, lieutenant.
START mister chekov, for compliance compute course and speed necessary.
START understand, i quite understand, captain.
START diverting to vulcan put us, how far behind schedule will?
START mister spock. with me come, please.
START deck five. changed course for vulcan, you have, mister spock. why?
START deny it do you?
START no. no, by no means, captain. quite possible, is it.
START then it, why'd you do?
START trying to help you, i am, spock.
START me no further questions ask. i will answer not.
START to report to the sickbay i order you.
START come in, spock. all ready for you, am i.
START going to get space sick i i think am.
START jim, got to get spock to vulcan, you have.
START he die, why must? why within eight days? explain.
START i not know.
START you say, convinced he knows what it is, you are?
START no, understand i not. explain. consider that an order.
START to do with biology, it has.
START of biology what kind?
START but you are a fish not, mister spock. you are.
START mister sulu, you not think.
START me alone let. me alone let!
START well, that, that is.
START course already plotted. it in laying, sir.
START i not understand.
START wet, your face is.
START christine, my name is.
START oh, be very glad to do that i would, mister spock.
START permitted is it?
START honoured, i shall be, sir.
START captain. standing by on vulcan hailing frequencies, are we, sir.
START spock, this is.
START lovely, she is lovely, mister spock. she, who is?
START t'pring, she is t'pring. my wife.
START lovely, it is lovely. cooler, i wish the breeze were.
START thinner than earth here the atmosp is.
START the marriage party approaches. them, i hear them.
START marriage party? your wife, you said t'pring was.
START this important, he never mentioned that his family was.
START kirk, this is.
START it, what is? what happened?
START take him, think spock can?
START it, i doubt it. his present condition not in.
START no! to be the one i am. agreed, it was agreed.
START forgiveness, i ask forgiveness.
START my friend understands not.
START to spock if i decline what happens?
START do it you cannot, jim.
START jim, listen, if you.
START what you mean, if both survive?
START going to have to kill him, you are, jim.
START to enterprise mccoy.
START over me i see no logic in preferring stonn.
START doctor, resigning my commission immediately, i shall be, of course.
START so appreciate your making the final arrangements, would i.
START you think you better check with me first, do not?
START nurse, you mind would, please?
START of course, mister spock, quite logical, your reaction was.
START come on, spock. go mind the store let us.
START of the inhabitants so far no sign. kirk out.
START aside from that, you say, a garden of eden, is it?
START captain, expressly forbidden, use of our phasers is.
START enterprise, alert! to beam up landing party stand by.
START no, captain. travel, i can travel.
START bones, you save him can?
START my way on. scotty. bones?
START i know not yet, jim.
START good. to yellow alert go.
START yellow alert. to yellow alert all stations go.
START try, i can try, captain.
START to starbase message, sir?
START to sickbay kirk.
START so, broken the treaty, they have.
START the klingon way research is not.
START yes, aware of that, i am, mister scott.
START seen different development at rates on different planets, have we.
START then transporting down, you and i are.
START leave spock at this time, i cannot.
START and it if that is not?
START i appreciate the compliment, jim, but.
START i understand. arrange a rendezvous schedule, we will. kirk out.
START perfect. of a mile away tyree's camp's a quarter.
START choice i have?
START they left. of orbit out.
START tyree. of his men some. cure.
START to the cave take him. tyree, i bring tyree.
START of eden you and your garden.
START you, i took you because you cast a spell upon me.
START of madness the night.
START oh, tyree, really hate that madness did you?
START it, what is?
START the stranger, he, where is?

START to kill him as you did here before, you have.
START it, what is? why stopped the images have they?
START to know why i demand.
START if patient will you be, to your questions the answers.
START perhaps they made me out of dreams, forgotten, you have.
START wear whatever you wish, i can, you wish be anything.
START fool, you are.
START perhaps if you asked me some questions, answer, could i.
START they control my mind, how far can?
START but to trick me with their illusions they try.
START war, of centuries ago thousands.
START why it is so barren up there that is?
START or of zoo specimens like me sit probing minds.
START you said that if i answered questions.
START why? to maintain a supply of zoo specimens just?
START with one of his animals is the keeper actually communicating?
START and if i prefer.

START to commander bridge.
START as you see, to escape accomplished nothing your attempt.
START i contact our ship want to.
START this a deception is? intend to destroy yourselves do you?

START but some form of trade would not, mutual cooperation.
START get back to the ship, let us.
START i cannot. go with you i cannot.
START go with you you see why i cannot.
START the female's true appearance, this is.
START give her back her illusion of beauty, you will?
START mister spock, coming on again, the system is.

START security clearance, i have, chief.
START mister spock, this is.
START stand by. warp out of orbit in one hour, will we.
START he live, how long will?
START bones, anything to do with spock, could this have?
START i read not you at all, jim.
START also half human, he is.
START he would make a false entry not.
START well, it, what is? sickness? injury? it, how bad is?
START with half vulcan science officer named spock.
START commodore! captain pike, gone, he is gone!
START mendez here. it, what is?
START going, the enterprise knows where she is, mister hansen.
START to hail us someone's trying, sir.
START your orders, you have, mister hansen. make no contact, will we.
START headed for talos four, spock is, all right.
START to sensors lock on. measure object now following the enterprise.
START computed. already past point of safe return, shuttlecraft is.
START of oxygen left two hours.
START spock, some logical reason for going there, would have.
START maybe. just gone mad, he maybe is.
START computer control. to shuttlecraft following us lock on.
START to tape abel seven baker go. execute instructions.
START the captain is it, mister spock?
START adequate, doctor. make no trouble, i will.

START yes, on the record, it is.
START your evidence present. screen on.
START i, tell you at this time, cannot, sir.
START nothing to do with it, that has.
START the meteorite beam has deflected it not, captain.
START as we go steady.
START we are going to go not, to be certain?
START oh, with yours i concur, definitely.
START you think i need one what makes?
START beginning to talk like a doctor, you now are, bartender.
START and not, i vote we do. deadlock, and since i am.
START settled into orbit, we have, sir.
START of earth zero point nine.
START man: men, they are men. humans, they are humans.
START the same old earth, and see it very soon, you will.
START yes, affirmative on the.
START time to show the captain our secret, i think it is.
START excellent, their health is, almost too good.
START i, i not understand.
START you will. perfect choice, you are.
START it, what is?
START for you plead signal, sir. go ahead, uhura.
START sir, decline, i respectfully decline.
START native of capella four, it is, is it not?
START beautiful, it is beautiful, but also very deadly.
START hard about, helmsman. for twenty four mark seven change course.
START captain, responding that ship is not.
START captain, making visual contact, they are.
START it on the screen put, lieutenant.
START never heard that language before, i have.
START no use, sir. refusing to answer, she is.
START yes, scotty, it, what is?
START mister arex, our speed, what is?
START sir, i, release the tractor beam, cannot.
START what you mean, mister sulu?
START to manual override go.
START still starship personnel we are, captain.
START aye, captain. almost gone, our engines are.
START contact in thirty nine seconds. thirty eight, thirty seven.
START thirteen, twelve, eleven.
START to execute course change get ready, mister sulu.
START impossible. been destroyed instantly, it should have.
START got to work, it is.
START fourteen seconds, thirteen, twelve.
START never mind, mister spock, no use, it is.
START we, where are?
START yes, scotty. we doing down there, how are?
START responding to our call, the alien ship is, captain.
START little choice we have.
START take a remarkable coincidence, that would, mister spock.
START my son may i introduce, karl four.
START then the young child in the playpen.
START true, that is, captain.
START welcome to use my ship, you are, captain.
START to babel after all we just might get you, commodore.
START meeting the speed of karla five's unmanned vessel, we are, captain.
START our course, how is, mister sulu?
START too young, he is, captain.
START yes, captain, but fill in for you, who will?
START what you mean?
START you mean i see what.
START tractor beam? how we do that, spock?
START you say whatever. what shall i do?
START correct, you are, of course. commodore april, yours, command is.
START commodore? captain april, i am, mister spock.
START very good. your post at the navigation console assume.
START vessel armed, captain. to impact nine seconds. eight, seven,
START but the enterprise crew, all children, they are.
START blossomed again, i see your flower has.
START if so kind you would be, captain.
START slaughter? of people hundreds?
START me see that let.
START that means he was responsible for it not.
START tell, his trial will, captain.
START trial? you mean kangaroo court. heard about dramian justice, have i.
START captain, becoming emotional, you are.
START or my part a tragic mistake on.
START i buy not that, bones. guard!
START it is there.
START sure, you are?
START of arrival estimated time, mister sulu?
START contact i shall make, sir?
START planning something, you are, captain?
START my guess unless i miss, friend demos, that is.
START he attacks what if, sir?
START but the hangar doors are open not, captain.
START to the federation now i demand that you report!
START i would, but out of communications range, we unfortunately are.
START stowaway, you are, commander.
START been tricked, have i.
START sure it is safe, you are, captain?
START decidedly. difference, there is, captain.
START ever been to, not the most enchanting place i have.
START of flowers plagues seldom leave behind fields, captain.
START outsiders they like not.
START surely you are an outsider not, commander. dramian, you are.
START inhospitable or not, he must get away not.
START disappeared, he is disappeared. almost as if he dematerialised, it is.
START advise against that i would, captain.
START mind if i ignore your advice i am sure you will not.
START seem to be advisable, caution would, captain.
START on the line, bones' life is, mister spock.
START cave dwellers? of your civilisation in the midst?
START of your doctor mccoy and his inhumane methods a result.
START you say it, demos, but not, that does.
START but how survive the plague did he?
START then tell us, you can. remember do you?
START get underway for dramia let us.
START sir, that, who is?
START pour on the coal, i will, captain.
START hope the trial hasn't started, let us.
START yes, mister spock. it, what is?
START hardly fit to testify at the trial, he is, captain.
START got to save him, we have.
START that it is not. it is.
START captain, blue, you are.
START been activated, general order six has?
START good. to sickbay report, mister sulu.
START but sir, monitor, who will?
START i assure you, capable, am i, mister sulu.
START to get mccoy, we have. must find an antidote.
START impossible. stricken, he too is.
START to get mccoy got.
START doctor, with me, just come, please.
START plague? why did you tell me not?
START doctor i am, spock, doctor. get us beamed aboard.
START blast it, spock, work harder. in the terminal stage, they are.
START bones, it that is. aurora, changing colour.
START jim? aurora? what.
START bones, it, you did!
START and forget about a certain stowaway we will.
START apologise, we must apologise.
START that supposed to mean, what is?
START hippocrates would have approved of lame excuses not, doctor.
START captain, established contact with the romulan commander, i have.
START for this unprovoked attack i demand an explanation.
START strange. it is on the charts not.
START mister spock, our chances, what are?
START after that ride, use some repairs, i could.
START the repairs progressing, how are, scotty?
START how like you that? so did mine.
START beginning to wonder, i am, bones, beginning to wonder, am i.
START you got there, what have, spock?
START sorry, i am sorry, spock, your, it is your.
START officer scott, will you join us for lunch not?
START hey, wait a minute. we did cause this to happen not.
START okay, gone far enough, this whole thing has!
START when you all finish laughing, appreciate an explanation, would i.
START captain, laugh, i never laugh.
START no joke, this is, sir.
START amazing. covered with ice, this deck is.
START to one guilty party the evidence all points, captain.
START you know who's behind these stunts you mean?
START well, it be what'll, swim at the beach?
START then it is woods.
START ah, more like it that now is. shall we?
START strange, that is. repeat the call.
START so peaceful, is it. so relaxing.
START and of all best, no practical jokes.
START that, what was?
START i am sure not. like someone chuckling it almost sounded.
START there, again, is it. definitely laughing at us, someone is.
START hear that right did i?
START never tell, i will.
START well, be, i will be.
START compliance, i suggest compliance, captain.
START with sugar on say pretty please.
START temper, temper. cool you off, perhaps this will.
START for a nap time, old girl. captain's orders.
START vacate sir? but.
START you bloody big scatterbrain. your monumental mind make up.
START we do to stop it, what can?
START twenty below and its still dropping must the temperature be.
START then move before we all turn into icicles, let us.
START come on, spock. that vulcan sense of humour, where is?
START hmm. as i thought just.
START spock, what, what mumbling about are you?
START but doctor, we cannot.
START turn up the heat could you?
START see what i can i will.
START captain, underway, we are underway.
START engine room reports all engines shut down, yet firing, they are firing.
START as as our course stabilizes soon, me a reading give.
START heading back to the neutral zone, we are.
START decelerating, we are decelerating, sir.
START jim, going on, what in heaven's name is?
START as much as i do you know, bones.
START wait a minute. method to this madness, there is.
START elaborate, captain.
START suggesting that the enterprise is seeking revenge are you?
START commander, no radio response from the large ship, there is.
START very well, refused surrender, it has. advance at attack speed.
START giving chase, the romulans are.
START yes, captain. take us nowhere near it, our course will.
START good! face going through there again i could not.
START me, it petrifies me.
START no! we cannot!
START my circuits! you tricked me, kirk. you, how could?
START going on, what the devil is?
START it is fair not.
START responding now, the controls are.
START yes, but later. let us spoil their fun just yet not.
START kirk captain, almost complete, settings are.
START commander bem, what doing here are you?
START already set controls, this one has, mister scotty.
START offered, assistance is.
START all right, we are.
START he will get far in there not.
START have had to go through here to escape, he would.
START i think, lost him, have we. that way.
START yes, and gathered is bem, the food they have.
START talking about the captain, are we.
START our phasers work not either.
START appear to be advisable, an alternate course of action would.
START go back to contact mister scott, one of us could.
START to be a model prisoner commander bem seems.
START have to wait until nightfall, we will.
START shut up. rescuing you we are.
START interfering with observations, you are.
START how you observe, this is, by being captured?
START as as any logical a way, spock commander.
START we always end up like this, how come?
START i believe, the correct earth term, that is.
START why you not try your vulcan nerve pinch.
START captain, only a vulcan, i am. limits, there are.
START solve our problems right now, either one could.
START with orders is compliance. disassemble, this one must.
START remarkable. colony creature, commander bem is.
START lieutenant arex, found them yet have you?
START no, sir. big planet, it is.
START we, get any readings at all now, cannot.
START no, use your weapons, do not.
START held in stasis, are we, captain.
START you, who are?
START you, who are?
START why here are you? why disturb you this place?
START found the captain yet have you?
START of some sort perhaps an offering, captain.
START here, i am here.
START good, this is. go. return go now and not.
START fled, he has fled.
START to enterprise kirk. to enterprise kirk.
START captain, all right are you?
START not, not on my ship you do.
START found, he is found, and leave, we will leave.
START no, destroy yourself, do not.
START you demand not punishment?
START humbled, i am humbled.
START go now we will.
START to enterprise kirk. beam us up.
START respect that also, pandro will.
START captain, you on a wise decision i compliment.
START take us out of orbit, mister sulu. go home, let us.
START captain, picking up a message, i am.
START it on audio put, lieutenant uhura.
START to sickbay kirk. emergency!
START to the point get, bones.
START contracted the disease, spock has. fatal to vulcans, is it.
START sure are you?
START suffocation, the result is.
START spock last without the drug, how long can?
START the symptoms be, what will, bones?
START to see me you wished, sir?
START no, not, it will not.
START that be all, will, captain?
START one other thing. cut your duty time in half, i have.
START captain, that will be necessary not. quite able, i am.
START all that is, spock. dismissed.
START hurt seeing him like that, will it.
START sir, picking up a ship ahead, our sensors are.
START to rendezvous time, mister arex?
START to ask i hate, but.
START it, what is, bones?
START conserving energy, was i, captain.
START you in sickbay mccoy wants.
START hurt a bit this will not, spock.
START an unnecessary assurance, doctor, to being untrue in addition.
START such restraint, welcome, would be.
START well, that is too bad not. to work back, mister spock.
START working any more the drug is not.
START increased speed, they have, sir, closing fast.
START to ship try ship.
START sensor report, mister spock. at the rendezvous point are they?
START no, sir. they had reached it not.
START compute new course, mister arex. see what's going on, let us.
START based on present data, say yes, would i.
START spock, all right are you?
START to sickbay bridge. emergency.
START you can do what, bones.
START to make contact still unable, sir.
START to captain kirk scott.
START good. nurse, he, how is?
START surgery, he needs surgery, captain, but live, he will live.
START he, how is, bones?
START following the intruder ship's trail, are we.
START know it it is the right one we even not.
START got to be, is it.
START to warp eight increase speed.
START deflectors up. yellow alert. to warp one cut speed.
START that, what was?
START also make quite a weapon. as she goes steady, sulu.
START to port hard, sulu. face them head on let us.
START i recognise the ship's markings, captain. an orion, it is.
START hailing us, they are, captain.
START it on visual put, lieutenant.
START hold on that, uhura. to stand by tell them.
START their hold sensors picking up the dilithium in, sir.
START to sickbay kirk.
START bones, much time how?
START hailing us, the orions are, sir.
START it on the screen put, lieutenant.
START counterproposal, you have?
START to face face? where?
START got to be a trap, it is, jim.
START of it no doubt, sir.
START already made up your mind, you have, have you not, jim.
START if this works not, lose you and spock, we could.
START if we not try, spock haves a chance not.
START escape, you are saying we cannot?
START plan, you have, lieutenant?
START it take, what will?
START to orion vessel enterprise.
START your terms i accept.
START jim, much time we have not. spock.
START the drug, as promised, captain. you wish scan it if.
START you, escape the enterprise, cannot.
START but destroy it, we can.
START it, what is?
START dilithium down there with them there is, sir.
START but yours, so will.
START captain, close, it was close.
START get up to the bridge, let us.
START gone, they are gone, sir.
START the orion vessel, have i, sir.
START spock, no way you can deny it, there is.
START doctor mccoy, i.
START to yours i still prefer my physiological structure.
START yes, gentlemen, back to normal, things are.
START religious leader, he not was?
START our soul, of the skorr the soul, was stolen.
START to its location is there any clue?
START then done, it is done.
START i, feel the soul, cannot. nowhere near it, we are.
START directional equipment that keys on indurite, it has.
START this place i like, got variety, it is.
START indicated, our direction is.
START this the mad planet why did the vedala call?
START means nothing. tell the way, i can. that way.
START certain are you, human?
START scout overhead, i will.
START i would say that not. unique personality, mister spock is.
START fascinating. but we are here on a pleasure trip not, lara.
START against what? no life on this planet, there is.
START and half.
START statistical probability.
START yes. but philosophy and poetry are appropriate here not.
START lava flow. to be expected, volcanic action is.
START him, i heard him.
START carefully, em. destroy us, one missed connection could.
START bought ourselves a little time we i figure have. few minutes.
START leave, of you all.
START captain, get the others away, you must.
START all getting away, we are.
START oh! and i was just ask going to, what next?
START on, we move on.
START have to carry the equipment, will we.
START come on, em, bit more.
START sorry, em. needing you will we be. sord.
START go ahead, i will.
START it, what is?
START no life on this planet, there is.
START guess, right, you are. this planet just gets on your nerves.
START tchar, be careful. you, we need you, too.
START sord, what think you saw back there did you?
START be no life on this planet, there should.
START know about it maybe the vedala did not.
START an impossibility, that is.
START think so? i am so sure not.
START it that is. of a long end, hard journey.
START much green memories, i already have.
START is this the shape of your people's primitive temples not?
START it, what is?
START keep working. cover you, will i.
START hit tchar, will we.
START to tchar what happened?
START rest awhile, we could. lara?
START no. come this far, we have.
START pretty. how we reach it?
START the walls are climbable not.
START exactly surprised you are not.
START maybe, get a line on it, can i.
START spock, our combined phasers disrupt the field, will?
START define the field's energy base i cannot, captain, but.
START tchar. of the seven gods in the name, why?
START fly and fight as a skorr, you now can.
START no offence, little ones, but me tackle him let.
START with you last week, captain.
START for retrieval call, now.
START me die let.
START going back with us, you are.
START what about tchar? how are you punish him going to?
START what you mean?
START we gone, how long were?
START long? about two minutes, i guess. understand i not.
START against all orders, it was.
START apparently desperate, the need was.
START the most impossible, you vulcans are, unimaginative.
START bones, that is helping the situation not.
START to their lot according, they beamed down six weeks ago.
START of me careless, mister spock. planetary life forms?
START jim, if lost, the others are, take the risk why?
START still a risk, is it.
START then beam back up, will we.
START to navigate on land it may be able.
START it can i know.
START get out of here let us.
START strange you did get a voice reply not.
START many reasons why we did not, there could be.
START of the neck concentrate on the underside.
START undamaged, i am undamaged. doctor mccoy where is?
START get you out, will we, bones.
START thanks. running out under there, the air was.
START you hurt were?
START captain, the beast, seem familiar to you did it?
START full of sand, my shoes are.
START doctor, amazing, your lack of scientific interest is.
START seen stranger things, i have, mister spock.
START to enterprise kirk.
START i not know. but at least, alive, are they.
START apparently alive. we sure cannot be.
START to believe they are i choose.
START to test the water first allow me, doctor.
START captain, too pure, the water is.
START nonetheless, too pure, is it.
START in other words, too good to be true, is it.
START new terraforming is not. it implies intelligent life forms.
START unless, of course, the pattern, the random choice is.
START spock, ever say anything straight out do you?
START gentlemen, please. work to do, have we.
START still alive, are we, are we not?
START if true, that is, spock, then.
START been travelling for hours, have we. where taking us are they?
START captain, it is there.
START five square kilometres, that must be.
START if the builders, these are, an admirable feat, is it.
START congratulations, doctor. most logical assumption.
START and definitely on the inside, we are.
START communicate with them some way, surely we can.
START you mean, some kind of a zoo, is it?
START or maybe they see how our toys work want to.
START possibility, that too is.
START got to communicate with them, we have.
START well, so for mythology much.
START real grass, this is.
START zoo? no animal, am i.
START been expecting you, we have.
START your communicator signal we heard.
START then why did you warn us not?
START six of you on the mission, there were.
START check her out, will i. help, i maybe can.
START you learned about the aliens what have?
START tried an escape have you?
START tried to communicate have you?
START company, we seem to have.
START to be getting a response you seem.
START my impression is that, laughing at me, are they.
START captain kirk, mister spock, nancy randolph, this is, our navigator.
START she, how is?
START the lactrans outside, what they do?
START feed us or do we shift for ourselves do they.
START to the same place always?
START then be there, my equipment should.
START then it that way think about, doctor.
START food. but feeding time it is not.
START all here, is it. damaged it they have not.
START of the situation what's your evaluation, markel?
START for the curators of a zoo a natural reaction.
START how? get through to them we cannot?
START telepathically, they communicate telepathically.
START between themselves, yes, but, mister spock, are vulcans telepathic not?
START how much learned have you?
START of us what's their impression?
START with another move how about coming up, then?
START if suggest, i may suggest, sir?
START little one, it is. child, could be.
START enterprise, captain kirk, this is. beam us aboard.
START worried about the enterprise, am i.
START well, stand here let us not. do something, let us.
START argh, the best thing we can do is!
START it, what is?
START i think, harmless, is it, but sure i am not.
START me to whatever it wants.
START jim, all right are you?
START yes. so, i think so.
START hold out against that many, i cannot.
START all right, i am. scotty, what doing here are you?
START with me it made contact.
START what learn did you?
START then how get here did you?
START what else know about us do they?
START of here do we get out?
START to transport everyone ready?
START offhand, say we learned to keep our hands off, would i.
START but so much more, there was.
START welcome back, we will be, in twenty or thirty centuries.
START either way, mister spock, hardly be our problem, will it.
START why glowing like that is it?
START mister sulu, our position, what is?
START carrying a stasis box detector, maybe no one else was.
START bring us about. investigate the beta lyrae system, will we.
START we are tourists here not, lieutenant.
START we, where are?
START kzinti spacecraft.
START then really working for the kzinti government, you are.
START of a slaver could that be a picture?
START the human, sulu, to be a slaver believes it.
START mister spock, move, i can move.
START so can i. off, the police web is.
START mister spock, we.
START the weapon, i have.
START no, they cannot. or rather, not, will.
START but seen all the phases we have.
START to another setting it may be the key.
START wrong. much of you they think not.
START no. see what this does do, let us.
START give them that we cannot!
START no idea, i have. generating power, is it.
START the kzinti frightened, it has.
START the kzint, legends of weapons haunted by their owners, have i.
START without certain code words, i may describe our location not.
START the null position, twist me widdershins until you reach. then.
START got it, have they.
START something we can do, must there be.
START that was the total conversion beam setting not.
START let them have that weapon we cannot.
START they are about to get it not, lieutenant.
START disrupter field.
START this rate at, never get over those old superstitions, will they.
START that thing, what the devil was?
START regaining consciousness, it is. surface, mister clayton.
START spock, to fire phasers prepare.
START to enterprise kirk. emergency.
START under attack, we are. beam us aboard, scotty.
START repeat, lost contact we have. come in, captain. come in.
START nothing, there is. just nothing, there is.
START still alive, they maybe are.
START functioning, their bodies are. metabolism, heart. everything but the lungs.
START breathe, cannot. suffocating. help. breathe cannot.
START to them what happened, doctor? it, what is?
START somehow accomplished naturally are you sure the mutation was not?
START highly sophisticated and completely unknown to us, it is.
START intelligent life forms on argo, that implies there are.
START what about you, spock? your logic tell you, what does?
START make contact as soon as possible, we will, mister scott.
START go away, air breathers. wanted here you are not.
START we will harm you not. friends, we are friends.
START understand i not. they said, saved us once, would they.
START that building in the centre. to be important it seems.
START nothing without consulting the ancient records, can we do?
START correct, rila is. you may speak.
START on the surface places you live not?
START this world not on.
START scott here. it, what is, doctor?
START you contact them sooner can?
START yes. examine the wreckage before we make judgement, let us.
START news, we have news, high tribune.
START still believe these creatures came in peace do you?
START we know not what to believe.
START to the big island go. bring assistance party.
START see anything did you?
START of them not a sign. wait a minute. who are.
START your race evolved from its ancient enemies that suggests.
START violent would strange that such a highly developed race be.
START then possible, reverse mutation is.
START the ruins, how far are, rila?
START another chamber there is.
START of the antitoxin what's the composition, bones?
START nephro, break the ordainments, we must.
START quickly, leave, we must leave.
START no, no, no time, there is.
START well, get started, let us.
START how you feel, jim?
START little dizzy. otherwise normal.
START i did believe such knowledge was possible not.
START start in three minutes, major tremors will, captain.
START incredible, it is incredible. of it all.
START as directed fire phasers, gentlemen.
START then safe, our people are.
START stabilize within a few hours, the seabed should.
START lose contact with each other like your ancestors, do not.
START pass ordainments to forbid it, we will.
START and we, this time, ignore them will not.
START nonetheless, have it on the record let us.
START correct, your information is. captain kirk, this is.
START sir, are we going to defend ourselves not?
START doing that for us, your deflector shields are, mister scott.
START dead on, sir. we, there in ten seconds, will be.
START captain, just gone out, our deflector shields have.
START dead, subspace radio channels are, sir.
START where go did they?
START tell, i cannot tell, sir. focus vision will not.
START we, where are, sir?
START aye, and that tricky devil, where is?
START totally depleted, scanners indicate the enterprise shields are, sir.
START sir, frozen, our weaponry is.
START to elysia welcome. devna, of laws interpreter.
START how freeze my weaponry did you?
START getting out we are.
START then pretty quick, we'd better do it, captain.
START if we find an answer, still take time, will it.
START that is just what we have got not.
START our dilithium crystals, it is, sir. deteriorating rapidly, they are.
START your computer got any miracles in, spock?
START to predict impossible, captain.
START what see you beyond your eyes, magen?
START gently, good magen. to us now return.
START impossible, it is impossible.
START covered every possibility have you? every factor?
START his crew and his ship unnecessarily jeopardising?
START but with the klothos this involves combining our ship.
START correct, that is.
START good. contact kor right away, will i.
START it, what is?
START it is against our laws to try to escape not.
START they die even if?
START their choice, is it.
START forgive me, commander. overcome by the moment, i was. goodbye.
START the stories of his being half human, true, must be.
START his mind perhaps the time continuum affected.
START become affected i wonder if we all have not.
START think my commander had manoeuvred brilliantly i would.
START and it, arranged, can be, practically speaking?
START your pardon beg, sir.
START it, what is, gabler.
START lost, we were lost.
START jim, worried about spock, i am. he is just acting normal not.
START under much pressure, he is, bones.
START talk to him, will i, bones. all i can do, it is.
START yes, captain. why you ask?
START the device, you have, kaz?
START go, you could. willing to take passengers, are we.
START done, we believe it can be.
START then interfere with your dream i shall not, captain.
START get away from here, human. my woman, this is.
START fail, you will.
START take these renegades with you, you would?
START them, we need them.
START to accelerate to warp six ready.
START enterprise, xerius, this is! come in, enterprise.
START sir, calling us, xerius is. he says, urgent, is it.
START go off, will it when you reach warp eight.
START it is there, sir.
START it matters not, bones.
START what matters, that is.
START entering its cycle of strongest emissions, arachna is, captain.
START it on the speaker put.
START signals appear random. beyond our reception capability, perhaps some are.
START natural radio source newly energised by, could be.
START intersat? been out of use for two centuries, that is.
START no, sir. repeated twice in the transmission, it was.
START mister sulu, for cepheus lay in a course.
START waste of time if you ask me, it is.
START for a single elliptic orbit set.
START to engineering bridge. scotty, your engines, how are?
START like happy kittens purring, captain.
START nothing, jim. of shock the gossamer mice show no signs.
START know yet, do not.
START but the hardest, dilithium molecules are, most rigid.
START mister scott! with the circuit work more trouble.
START you sound like, blathering, you are, man. wait, coming, i am coming.
START spock, slumping are you?
START captain, happening, the most incredible thing is.
START we know. apparently expanded, the whole ship has.
START complex beyond anything in my experience, only that it is.
START kirk here. how holding out are they, scotty?
START to sickbay kirk.
START bones, i need some answers. to us what's happening?
START the test tissue, there is, jim, with the stable infrared compared.
START then right, spock's theory is. contracting, we are contracting.
START agreed. and accelerating, it is accelerating.
START it keep on, how long can?
START miss chapel, the composition of this decoration, what is?
START are all our uniforms xenylon not?
START yes, and all been shrinking proportionately with us, they have.
START affected, that means only organic matter is. but how?
START the strands would break not, jim, just quit winding, would they.
START then calculate the limits to our shrinkage, we can.
START possible, it is possible. feed the data into the computer banks, i will.
START spock, we ultimately shrink, how small will?
START sulu! his leg's broken i think. need a splint, we will.
START get him to sickbay, let us. to stations every one back.
START certainly worth a try, it is.
START in the lab shelf supplies, it is. get it, will i.
START for you no more climbing heights, nurse. got that clear?
START yes, captain. but also got the miniature laser, i have.
START it, how is, sulu?
START feel it knitting i can, sir.
START through, results on dna reduction limits have come, captain.
START they, what are?
START of thirty two point nine factor.
START yes, captain. of enterprise controls well past the operative point.
START as good a place as any to beam down, is it.
START to engineering kirk. scotty, you hear me can?
START i think i see.
START scotty, you is it?
START captain, deafen us for sure, you will!
START done to my people, you forbid me after what you have?
START my officers, where are?
START spock, the terratins, who are? from, where'd they come?
START bridge crew, to beam up prepare.
START subspace radio now operational, sir. reading, starbase twenty three is.
START mister arex, for immediate departure from this area prepare.
START to making it more than honorary we came rather close.
START think harry mudd is down there do you, spock?
START you just say why cannot, mudd's probably there.
START did, i just did, doctor.
START harry, darling. lonely for you, i was.
START please, darling, to the ship with me come back.
START three hundred credits, or the.
START with free will i surrender myself. of the law mercy.
START fine. see you in court, i will, harry.
START minor bruise, captain. live, he will live.
START and to swindle honest miners came here.
START really a very attractive intelligence, your mister spock is.
START it, what is?
START think about it, darling. with you mister spock in love.
START let you know the results of my analysis, i will.
START it, what is?
START absorbed, a temporary effect as the liquid is.
START better, i feel better.
START did i tell you not?
START you should, be in the brig, you should, harry.
START oh, you are right, darling.
START injured are you, miss chapel?
START no. no, i, fine, i am fine. feeling all right are you?
START you like me to would not, well, stay? help you?
START be illogical that would, miss chapel.
START yes. yes, stupid would it be.
START harry mudd, you swindling.
START come to collect on your guarantee i have, mister mudd.
START completely successful you are implying the potion was not?
START it on screen put.
START mudd. and christine, he has christine. in danger, she is. my love.
START going planet side, is he.
START no. with my christine not.
START spock, yourself you are obviously not. maybe some rest.
START then transport down with you, i will.
START jim, is that wise, his condition in?
START jim, this in the shuttlecraft bay the search party found.
START of mudd's love crystals one.
START lucky for us they not work.
START it out check, bones. me an immediate report send.
START well, planned on it i had not.
START thanks jim. good to have a friend like you, it is.
START darling, all right are you?
START kirk, of here get us out.
START responding they are not.
START worry, do not. safe will you be, darling.
START coming closer, are they.
START my affair, that is.
START get a few things straight, i think we should.
START yes, to control our emotional reactions, have we.
START the effect of the potion last, how long does, harry?
START harry, any of the crystals left, do you have?
START contact, i made contact.
START you record his confession may i help, nurse?
START you? you would be the last person, choose, would i.
START guarantee it, i can.
START yes, as beautiful as i remembered it just. nothing's changed.
START you so very much thank.
START real it is hard to believe they are not.
START lovely. them like that anymore they just make not.
START with his head off. with his head off!
START to transporter room uhura. the emergency, what is? respond, please.
START i see. bones, you thinking about that book were?
START mister sulu, experience any strange occurrences did you?
START somewhere underground, his quarters are, are they not?
START be, any indication of where that would?
START you are being detained so your master will leave not.
START your name for it, that is.
START why think you the enterprise is my master?
START redundant, your questioning is.
START word meaning to cease to function, that is?
START built like a fortress, this planet is.
START enterprise, read me do you?
START to bridge scott. of phaser bore commencing beam down.
START to bridge scott. got problems, we have.
START an inscription, there is, several languages.
START well, gentlemen, it appears that, on our own now, are we.
START been changed before, programmes have, lieutenant.
START believe me. no reason to harm them there is.
START they serve the sky machine, but essential they are not.
START oh, but they are. most essential, they are.
START attempt to disconnect me, do not.
START with your function you sound less than enchanted.
START what you want, signs pointing the way?
START doctor, i only meant it seems like, wasting time, are we.
START sorry, i am sorry, sulu. worried about uhura i am.
START dead, phasers are! for the cave run!
START to amuse our amusement park no longer seems content.
START please, call off that beast. why doing this are you?
START mister arex, what doing are you?
START to that i believe you may know the answer, doctor.
START me? what talking about are you?
START and to or not whether it wants.
START perfect, bones. which arm want do you?
START i submit, captain, that, the more qualified subject, am i.
START for one thing my knowledge of computers.
START and for another his tough vulcan hide.
START your arguments seem sound both. go ahead, bones.
START i believe, find ten cc's adequate, you will.
START been almost five minutes, it is, captain.
START of mechanical nursemaid it looks like some kind.
START i think of that, not in my wildest dreams would!
START visitor, have we.
START got to make those rocks, we have. our only chance, it is.
START i presume, the planet's master computer, you are.
START to the keeper what happened?
START old, he was old. to function he ceased.
START sky machines? slaves? what talking about are you?
START new computer!
START dead end, is it!
START masters of the sky machine, you are?
START shock, this is.
START mister scott, now functioning normally, all systems are.
START here, we must have more of these discussions while you are.
START mister spock, to take on that duty would you care?
START find it most interesting, i would, captain.
START then agreed, it is agreed. to enterprise kirk.
START reverse power. our position hold. deflector screens on.
START deflectors up. sir, taking considerable power to hold position, it is.
START everything, repaired, can be, captain.
START an incredible experience, captain. this scientifically fascinating i find.
START ride her through, will we, bones. we do, what else can?
START her through where ride?
START we, where are?
START captain, the subspace radio. dead, it is dead.
START stopped, even the ship's chronometers have.
START ship's life support systems fading. jim, oxygen, we need oxygen.
START jim, got to do something we have.
START ah, humans. lovely primitive humans. you do anything right cannot?
START working, everything is, my friends.
START it cannot. it is logical not.
START look around you, spock. working, everything is.
START welcome! searching for me, i knew eventually humans would come.
START you, who are?
START this all quite absorbing i find, doctor.
START probably because you are not very natural to begin with, spock.
START play, children will.
START you superstitiously call magic our universe operates by what.
START just my imagination but, i know this is.
START love philter?
START it, what is? what's wrong?
START captain kirk, what.
START all right, everyone onboard is?
START mister scott, bewildered, i am bewildered, all, that is. but enough, that is.
START if it there lucien put.
START weapons status, mister scott? to protect ourselves, we may have.
START forget it, spock. work it will not.
START what doing are you?
START to protect ourselves learning, lucien.
START but you made mistakes, your powers used.
START and for it burned. burned!
START and loneliness and fear.
START i will, asmodeus. of earth i am not.
START yes, different, you are. hear a defence, the court will.
START as my first witness i call lucien.
START indeed, captain. elaborate could you?
START submit, captain. the power to fight us you have not.
START captain, you know use the magic. believe.
START understand i not.
START all systems go, captain. back to normal, are we.
START really matter does it?
START confused, life readings are, sir. i, decipher them, cannot.
START it, what is, mister sulu?
START going to have to see this yourself, you are, sir.
START that thing, what is?
START ow! been a thorn, must have.
START been poisoned, he is. unknown toxin.
START you help him can?
START get a correlation with any known poison i cannot.
START that will be necessary not.
START you, who are?
START called agmar i am. help, i believe we can.
START getting a reading on them are you?
START moment, captain. unclear, the results are.
START captain, of botanical origin, these beings are.
START so seem, it would seem.
START to the planet phylos welcome.
START to him what happened?
START minor achievement.
START been humanoid aliens here before, there have.
START of communication your method.
START come. show you, will i.
START happening, we had no way of knowing what was.
START alive then, you were?
START they will work on any setting not, sir.
START i think, after you, is it, jim.
START to enterprise kirk.
START what think you they will do with us, sir?
START sorry, i am sorry, captain kirk, but no other way, there was.
START what talking about are you? where taken spock have they?
START spock, where is?
START my first officer not without.
START to enterprise kirk. beam us up, scotty.
START hate to resort to clubs and knives, i would.
START aye, sir, but i like not it.
START i, neither do, but to be necessary it appears. energise.
START sure i can take too much of this i am not.
START believe it i cannot.
START getting ready to go on a trip, looks like they are.
START agmar said, a peaceful people, were they.
START they are sure, now. but what about before?
START of keniclius or spock any indication?
START your work carry on?
START to spock or the master what if something happens?
START like that just, captain?
START though here, the way is, gentlemen.
START hear something did you?
START i am sure not.
START much further now not, captain.
START operate they not. agmar!
START it, i see it. it, i see it. keep going.
START dying, he is dying. to his brain something's happened. electrical activity decreasing.
START captain, out, i am out. empty, the chemical sprayer is.
START of my way out, mister. an order, that is.
START no use, is it, mister scott. i, get through, cannot.
START our ship calling that is, spock. you answer them.
START slipping away, spock is. there is much time left not.
START sure we are getting through, i am, but they are acknowledging not.
START what i call close, that is, mister scott.
START hope it was information they could use, let us.
START no! broken must the mould be.
START spock: i believe not so.
START no! our dream must be allowed to die not.
START murderer! killed spock, you have!
START spock. spock, you old.
START be honoured i would. if allowed, will i be.
START inscrutable? sulu, the most scrutable man i know, you are.
START identified the vessel have you, mister spock?
START impossible that is, spock. over five years carter winston's been missing.
START incredible. him, it is him.
START you gentlemen know me it seems.
START my fiancee? this starship anne's aboard?
START right as usual, spock is, bones.
START are you suggesting i am quite human not, doctor?
START completed, the captain is inquiring if the examination is, doctor.
START yes, so, i suppose so.
START sorry, i am sorry, anne. meet again, i never thought we would.
START carter, it, what is?
START but survive, you did. alive, you are, and together again, we are.
START intruding i hope i am not, captain.
START no, come in, mister winston.
START weren't you your cabin going to, sir?
START mister sulu, for ratar three lay in a direct course.
START the order, that was, helmsman.
START an admirable mission, captain, but our ship if we endanger.
START been his reputation, that has.
START the conn, you have, mister spock.
START take the conn i will, mister spock.
START the reason you gave, i believe that was, captain.
START examine you, perhaps doctor mccoy should, captain.
START doctor, what i do? i still love him.
START not, i have not. i do, what can?
START i do for you, what can, captain?
START i want a complete medical examination, bones. something's just happened.
START there are many places one could hide in here not.
START taken a little nap, i must have.
START something wrong about this room, there is.
START so i think not, doctor.
START that, i saw that, but it i believe not.
START to bridge spock. me on ship's audio put.
START anne, what doing are you?
START lieutenant nored, you, stopped him, could have. you fire why did not?
START bridge, the captain, this is. what's happened?
START it was deliberate not, you, i assure you.
START like a few minutes to inform my crew, would i.
START seem so, would it.
START surrender my ship i will not.
START what doing are you?
START captain, coming down, our deflector shields are.
START to engineering bridge. scotty, to the shields what's happened?
START mister scott is here not, sir.
START him, we need him. override the controls and shut those doors.
START it take to fix, how long will?
START carter? what say did he?
START how die did he?
START so much like him, you are, his voice, his mannerisms.
START say he loved me, did he.
START but unfortunately, i cannot.
START without deflectors, just a clay pigeon for them, we are.
START suggest capitulation, practicality does, captain.
START captain, coming up again, the deflector shields are.
START only one shield, that is.
START yes, sir, but between us and the romulans, it is.
START someone tell me what's going on, will?
START that, what manner of beastie is?
START over, i assume the danger to your ship is.
START why do it did you?
START your mind about the romulans what changed?
START happen to me now, what will?
START captain, assign me that duty could you.
START but seem me, you have. you know what i am.
START know i not. i.
START the guard detail, you have, lieutenant.
START firing on him, are they.
START him, they got him.
START scotty, that pilot yet, you have got?
START dead, our engines are.
START the phasers not work, sir.
START well, always throw rocks, we could.
START scotty, get that pilot did you?
START but integrate him i cannot. the system's been discoordinated.
START captain, message coming in, i have, sir.
START it on the viewscreen put.
START my ship release.
START that, what was? lieutenant, cut off that frequency.
START power, they still have? we still control them?
START captain, afford to lose that grain, you cannot.
START incredible. require, the amount of energy that field must.
START maintain the stasis field they could not.
START down, apparently their battle capacity is. they only damaged it.
START veering off, they are.
START scotty, you integrate that pilot now can?
START so, i think so, captain.
START to the transporter room call mccoy. spock.
START have, him, you got?
START to be it appears.
START to think about it i want not.
START and got tribbles with him, he is. tribbles!
START captain, safe tribbles, these are.
START no such thing as a safe tribble, there is.
START well, at least, neat, is it.
START the klingons chasing you, why were, jones?
START i know, how should? notoriously bad tempers, klingons have.
START mention ecological sabotage, they did.
START me? saboteur? ridiculous.
START pretty emphatic, captain koloth was.
START what do did you?
START well, i did know it was a klingon planet not.
START captain, we talk this over could not? think so i did not.
START he really seems the saboteur type not, jim.
START captain, picking up a klingon battle cruiser, sensors are.
START quite a marksman, captain koloth is.
START changed course, they have. coming in again, they are.
START perhaps they have had enough time to recharge it not.
START or something else, the purpose of the attack was.
START well, mister spock, any ideas, you have?
START always throw tribbles at them, we could.
START i thought vulcans did have a sense of humour not.
START not, we do not, captain.
START of captain koloth's ship any sign?
START mister jones, in enough trouble already, you are.
START captain, harmless little tribble. they hurt, what can?
START hungry, they are hungry, captain.
START captain, coming back, the klingons are.
START of the devil speak.
START jim, something about these tribbles, there is.
START done it that is. caught, we are caught.
START help it, not if i can.
START are you going to sit down not, sir?
START i think, stand, will i.
START mister scott, going to implement emergency defence plan b, are we.
START yet you know not, do you?
START others, you must have.
START they completely overrun the planet jones sold before.
START and all you want that is?
START the glommer, we must have.
START my claim i withdraw.
START captain, filled with tribble, the engine room is.
START five seconds. four, three.
START it on ship's speaker put.
START more like music than a message, is it.
START captain, being probed, we are.
START from where? you trace it can?
START you identify it can?
START to be calling us it seems.
START strange. yes, the same feeling myself, i get.
START resemble a summons, it does.
START to a summons i find no resemblance, captain.
START you wanted me, lieutenant? all right are you?
START logically, we must assume, created by the probe, are they.
START sir, what visions? anything we see not.
START miss chapel, you see not anything, either?
START no, i think not so, carver. do it, spock will.
START something compelling about it, there is.
START yes, it too i feel, bones.
START no apparent danger, there is, spock. go, let us.
START here, they are here.
START oh, such wondrous ones. us, they honour us.
START how know you our names?
START the signal? distress call, was it not?
START to the slumber chambers take them. rest, they must rest.
START probably that nectar. potent as saurian brandy, it is.
START of medical summation, biological, astrophysical scans.
START to security officer davison lieutenant uhura.
START what doing are you?
START of this ship taking command.
START return to our duties aboard ship, we must.
START yes. duties. it, that is. duties. i have.
START go, we must go.
START of you very thoughtful, love.
START me keep it i wonder why they let.
START they saw no practical use in it perhaps.
START cortropine. could help. strong stimulant, it is.
START the urn. the only place, is it.
START they are here not, theela.
START actually draining our life forces, you mean they are?
START we have, how long do, spock?
START to be aging ten years per day we seem, captain.
START ten years? in four days, dead, we will be!
START to enterprise spock.
START greetings. theela, i am theela. of this compound head female.
START to your ship return. you are wanted here not.
START until we find captain kirk, we will leave not.
START search the temple. of two parties.
START of them anywhere no sign.
START it, what is?
START spock, it is spock. there, a panel somewhere, must be.
START got to get out of here, have we.
START that, we tried that.
START wait! tell you everything, i will.
START see, we shall see. of the enterprise the men, reveal them.
START drowning, they are drowning! they, where are?
START many cusecs from here, the nearest water accumulation is.
START like a pool or a tub that looks.
START the urn in the garden, it is.
START no results, captain. tried everything we know, have we.
START the key, perhaps the transporter is.
START to what key?
START but never been done before, this has. it fails suppose?
START scotty, losing them, we are!
START work did it?
START more handsome than ever, you are.
START tell captain kirk, kept the agreement, have we.
START we become as other women, how quickly will?
START only take a few months, doctor mccoy says it should.
START captain, now approaching sensor range of the cloud, we are.
START our present position put up, lieutenant arex.
START captain, disappeared from navigation scan, alondra has.
START come between us and the planet could the cloud have.
START spock, possible the cloud consumes planets is it?
START sir, changing course, the cloud is.
START but it continues on that course if.
START how much time have do they?
START certain there'd be planetwide panic, is it.
START of mantilles who's the governor, jim?
START captain, getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors, i am.
START still got us, is it.
START to fire all phasers into cloud mass prepare.
START firing. no effect, captain.
START to absorb the phaser energy the cloud appeared, captain.
START floating inside the cloud, we are.
START some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter, the objects are.
START scotty, for an antimatter charge prepare the shields.
START to my quarters transfer it.
START time to save some people, you have, bob.
START how are you choose going to?
START reached the entrance to the central core, have we, captain.
START what we do now, knock?
START those things, what are?
START we have, how much time do?
START to maximum increase deflector shields.
START to maximum screens, sir.
START scotty, got ten minutes left, have we.
START holding, the force field is. go, let us.
START the brain located, where is?
START captain, living creature, this is. starfleet regulations.
START i believe, what i just said, that is, doctor.
START to engineering kirk.
START incoming message, sir. governor wesley of mantilles, it is.
START it on the viewscreen put, lieutenant.
START to mantilles thirty one minutes and four seconds, sir.
START bob, katie, where is?
START worry, do not, bon. all right, will she be. goodbye.
START in time, can you do it?
START to mantilles twenty six minutes exactly, sir.
START ready, the procedure is, sir.
START mantilles, how near is, mister arex?
START your order awaiting, captain.
START stopped, the cloud has, sir.
START spock, it, you did! leaving, the cloud is.
START mister sulu, get out of here, let us, through that grid.
START spock, what perceive did you?
START of the universe the wonders, captain. incredible, completely incredible.
START returning, the travellers are.
START what you mean, who's he? you know mister spock.
START not, afraid i do, jim.
START to enterprise kirk.
START you, who are?
START no, but if, reality, is it, what happened?
START but changed, something was.
START also research the vulcan family history requested did you?
START correct that is not.
START in this case, it is.
START to thirty vulcan years past twenty.
START the date was.
START of tasmeen the twentieth day.
START how know you this?
START this cousin, his name, what was?
START spock, now, did selek look like you do?
START all, i hear all.
START possible if no other major factor is changed, is it.
START andorians are known for their charity not.
START ready to receive you, the time and place are.
START spock: true that is not. my father.
START peace and long life. of my family, you are?
START honoured, i am honoured. is something wrong, cousin?
START to our forefathers a family resemblance, no doubt.
START to understand him better than my husband you seem.
START but the twentieth day of tasmeen, tomorrow is.
START lost track of time, i seem to have.
START sarek, gone, our son and the visitor are.
START you think not he would harm spock?
START my duty, it was, spock.
START spock: always say thank you, mother says you should.
START known for her graciousness, the lady amanda is.
START you will i dare say. come now.
START your father's wish, that is?
START spock: how know did you?
START spock: dying is he?
START spock: bring a healer here, i can.
START late, the hour is. urgent, i trust your errand is?
START spock, you are, of sarek son, not are you?
START spock: healer, hurry.
START be long now it will not, old friend.
START face such a loss without tears, a vulcan would.
START spock: do, is there nothing you can?
START i trust you can explain why, necessary, was it?
START returning, the traveller is.
START to the ship i sent the others up. what happened?
START changed this time, one small thing was. pet died.
START enterprise, the captain, this is. to beam up two.
START to reverse course stand by.
START captain, the source of the radio emissions that is.
START captain, still gaining speed, we are.
START no good, sir. still falling toward it, we are.
START we have, how much time do?
START captain, another signal there is. listen.
START as she goes steady, mister sulu. maintain orbit.
START slingshot effect, mister spock? enough power, have we?
START need some time for the computations, will i, captain.
START coming from that ship, is it, captain.
START sure, you are, mister spock?
START mister spock, of that ship's power source any indication?
START now we a lighter and stronger material than anything have.
START look, every pod, all been burst open, they have.
START aye, from the inside, of them from the looks.
START been some accident to get almost every pod, must have.
START to enterprise kirk.
START negative, captain. transmitting, it stopped transmitting when you beamed aboard.
START what make you of it, spock?
START me the creeps gives. like something's watching us i feel.
START it too i feel, captain.
START enterprise, read me do you? sulu?
START cut our way out of here, we can.
START you mean, trapped here, are we? no communication, nothing?
START to shield this room something. but it from what shield?
START aboard their ship, possibly from whatever had come.
START quite right, mister scott. of life no known form.
START it hold, will?
START it, what is?
START sure i am not, but i think.
START message from three hundred million years ago?
START to get a translation i may be able.
START of here get out! hurry!
START of cake piece, sir. now, here they come.
START captain, with you something's beamed aboard.
START it back out transport.
START to crew sickbay reports no injuries, sir.
START to hull or engines no damage, captain.
START of a heart like the beating.
START to sickbay bridge.
START something's jammed the circuits. magnetised, they are magnetised.
START you, i thank you, sir.
START off, phaser banks were, captain. themselves, they activated themselves.
START and mutual override did work not?
START sir, get into the core, we cannot.
START of all energy drained, sir.
START have a very small field, would it.
START activated, it is activated, captain, but only an area three metres square.
START get a magnetic flux reading there now do you?
START absorbed the memory banks, it has, captain, of them all.
START extinguished, all nonessential systems are. obey me, you will.
START stop! hurt him, you will.
START obey, i will obey. let him go.
START all right i am, captain.
START we dealing with, what are, spock?
START the heart of the galaxy, that is, captain.
START aware of that, i am, mister spock.
START to activate auxiliary controls ready, captain.
START only be operated manually, the auxiliary warp drive controls can.
START correct, that is. activate the manual controls, you will. obey!
START to activate warp drive unit standby.
START gone is it?
START interesting. of magnetic storms in this sector no indications.
START manned by vulcans, the intrepid is, is it not?
START yes, right that is, bones.
START it, what is, spock? in pain are you?
START come on, spock, go down to sickbay, let us.
START to the sickbay get.
START no, no, no. an order, that is.
START dead, it is dead.
START it die i sensed.
START feel a starship die, not even a vulcan could.
START rendered your history a bit less bloody, it might have.
START i, filter out the distortion, cannot, sir. getting worse, is it.
START to warp three slow.
START we looking for, exactly what are, mister spock?
START assume that, i would.
START that, what is?
START hold present course. to warp one slow.
START aye, sir. probe ready. to library computer switching data feed.
START that, what was?
START the telemetry probe, sir. no signal from it, there is.
START none, i have none, captain. insufficient data.
START just dizzy i am. all right, will i be. fine, i am fine, sir.
START kirk here. it, what is?
START not unless, feeling ill, is she. got an emergency here, i have.
START giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet, am i.
START good. kirk out. our position hold, mister kyle.
START spock, me an update on the dark area ahead give.
START to insufficient information no analysis due.
START so much help far that is not.
START all right i am. of darkness distance from zone, mister kyle?
START to starfleet complete transmission, sir.
START of the zone in one minute penetration, seven seconds, sir.
START it is coming from communications not, sir.
START captain, gone, the stars are!
START then to the stars kindly tell me what happened.
START to mccoy kirk.
START asking how, i am, mister. answers, i want answers. kirk out.
START bones, it, how bad is?
START affected, two thirds of the personnel are.
START why? how? any answers, do you have?
START and where we are, between where we were.
START trying to be funny are you, mister spock?
START never occur to me, it would, captain.
START any ideas, you have, spock?
START to captain kirk sickbay.
START jim, to the life indicators according, the energy levels.
START to the life monitors according, dying, we are dying.
START all right are you?
START that, what was?
START he just gave us reverse power. forward, we lurched forward.
START doctor. life function indicators. started a sharp drop again, have they.
START what you think, scotty? forward thrust?
START doctor, to be stabilising they seem.
START it you sensed, what was?
START of death the touch.
START and what think you they felt?
START it, that ought to do. to captain kirk engineering.
START kirk here. it, what is, scotty?
START to try it ready when you are, sir.
START the power to pull it off, do we have, scotty?
START to launch a probe prepare, mister chekov.
START aye, sir. for launch probe ready, sir.
START impact in seven point three seconds, probe will.
START with the probe are we still in contact?
START yes, sir. to mister spock data being relayed.
START an amoeba that is.
START send one man in, we could, pinpoint its vulnerable spots.
START suicide mission, it is.
START it first and died the vulcans saw.
START just because the vulcans failed.
START more capable, am i.
START gentlemen, i am taking volunteers not.
START you are going you think not?
START better qualified as a command pilot than you are, am i.
START gentlemen, decide, i will decide.
START to captain kirk engineering.
START very well. for launching prepare the shuttlecraft.
START right. get a few things i need, will i, jim.
START then of your own superstitions employ one. me luck wish.
START for shuttlecraft launch all systems clear. sir.
START lieutenant uhura, to the computers channel automatic telemetry directly.
START enormous and growing worse, power drain is.
START you bet want to?
START spock, for the shields save your power.
START last only forty seven minutes, calculations indicate the shields will.
START of those things you mean there'll be two?
START spock, read me do you? spock, read me do you?
START captain, getting telemetry i am.
START mister chekov, as it comes in telemetry analysis.
START we have, how much time do?
START it on put, lieutenant.
START how you feel?
START your mind what's on?
START scotty, how much power do, left, have we?
START exactly. to divert power on my signal prepare. kirk out.
START have, something to say, you got?
START through, we are through, sir.
START aware of that, i believe everybody is, mister chekov.
START captain, only twenty six percent power reserves after entry, we have.
START impulse power, do we have, scotty?
START committed, we are committed.
START probably like phasers, that thing would. power, it eats power.
START we, use the power to destroy it, cannot.
START aye, it could swallow that not.
START on its way, it is, sir.
START helmsman, when estimate arrival at nucleus do you?
START how close are you it going to?
START point blank range. implant it then back away, we will.
START why? range of, the probe has.
START programming complete. for launch ready.
START despite what spock said, still plenty sensitive, it is.
START estimate we, out in six point thirty seven minutes, will be.
START lieutenant, me spock's voice channel get. highest possible gain.
START risk the ship further on my behalf, do not.
START shut up, spock! rescuing you we are.
START almost out. approaching the membrane, we are, sir.
START just written our epitaph, you may have, mister scott.
START how i know not, sir, but still with us, it is.
START spock, alive, you are!
START be so smart, do not, spock. you botched the acetylcholine test.
START spock, mccoy, beaming down, we are. standard equipment.
START of industrialisation the beginnings.
START so going down to recontaminate them, we are.
START argue about it let us not. go study it, let us. energise.
START like coming home, this is.
START sir, you mind explaining that statement would, please?
START weapon, that is. with that be careful.
START well, those firearms are necessary not.
START to make trouble you trying?
START give me those baby blue eyes, do not.
START i go not for that innocent routine.
START my life i never heard such stupid questions in.
START krako's getting more gall all the time.
START this how you greet all your guests is?
START sir, there are several questions, like to ask, would i.
START ask the boss. nothing i know not. get moving.
START this is the contamination, looking for, you are, jim.
START no, thank you. mister oxmyx, you are.
START me, that is, pal.
START my first officer, this is, mister spock, doctor mccoy.
START yes. judging from what, seen so far, have we, i agree.
START the government here, you are?
START but other bosses, there are, other territories?
START how know you about krako?
START us, he hit us, boss.
START take care of it, will i.
START hey, wait a minute. the book, that is.
START i know, a book, is it.
START the book. it, they left it, the other ship. the horizon.
START you said, imitative, were they, and the book.
START i want not any more cracks about the book.
START leave any other books did they?
START what you want is it?
START mister oxmyx, quite explicit, my orders are. under no circum.
START see how this thing works, let us.
START of the question out.
START hold it. communication device, it is.
START how work does it?
START locked onto my ship's systems, it is.
START the bible, is it.
START yeah, well, the worst gangster of all, oxmyx is.
START oh, yes, yes. waste my time i would not.
START yes. turned up, the second card is, except on tuesdays.
START if dark on tuesday, it were.
START never computed them, i have, captain.
START get it, i will.
START surely, coming, you are, captain.
START i will, but bringing bela oxmyx with me i am.
START jim, you cannot.
START hold it! okay, pally, going for a ride, are we.
START if you not mind, rather walk, would i.
START beginning to get the idea i am.
START mister spock, what doing on this frequency are you?
START so the fed, you are, huh? well, well, well, well, well.
START you make a deal want to.
START right, that is, deal. to help me i want you.
START sorry, i am sorry, krako. no deal.
START too bad, that is. put him on ice!
START you mean, giving up, you are?
START mister spock, making contact from the surface, mister oxmyx is.
START on audio, lieutenant. mister oxmyx, mister spock, this is.
START irrelevant, since here, we are here.
START he put a bag on our captain, why would?
START show no further hostility, you will?
START businessman, am i, pally. what you say?
START since our captain back, we must have, i accept.
START you mean, going to trust him, you are?
START now, beginning to make sense, you are.
START to do you know what.
START mister oxmyx, i understood we had an arrangement, truce.
START think that, i was hoping you would, dummy.
START trying to help you, are we, oxmyx.
START sir, employing a double negative, you are.
START yeah, but to be the unity, i got.
START we did, captain. our return the situation required.
START illogical would to deny the facts be, doctor.
START then you mind not if i play a hunch?
START what are we do now going to, jim?
START to be it ought. it cost a bundle.
START fliwer, captain.
START that bad, it was?
START like the trusting type they look not.
START your pardon i beg?
START going to hit somebody, you are. can i watch?
START them ears, you where'd get?

START mister krako, not, i do not, er.
START you trust all your men can?
START miniscule. very small piece.
START that, how much is?
START that is, er. figure it out later, we will.
START you guys had laws i thought. no interference.
START who's interfering? taking over, we are. check?
START your cut what's?
START to enterprise kirk.
START all right, scotty. with krako we made a deal.
START do you think, wise, that is, sir?
START aye. indeed, i know indeed.
START rights, i got rights.
START faster than walking, is it.
START but as safe not.
START afraid of cars are you?
START not at all, captain. your driving that alarms me, it is.
START spock, got the hang of it i have. now go on.
START they, where are?
START knowing krako, probably send them back on a blotter, he will.
START to enterprise kirk.
START krako on ice, you got?
START of the phone find the man at the other end.
START i sure know not what you think you are talking about.
START with it get. giving the orders here, am i.
START advise you to keep dialing, would i, oxmyx.
START and your percentage what's?
START listen. ship, they got. i know. there, i was there.
START what, of boys a couple?
START going to believe my eyes i am not.
START over four hundred guys there, there are.
START your story, that is, buster.
START put you down, my boys will.
START i already seen it. nothing, you are, fed.
START well, all right. go ahead. get smart, do not.
START hello, scotty. kirk, this is.
START gee, some trick, that is.
START hey, see that did you?
START talking about a percentage, he was.
START talking about both, was i.
START reasonable, it is reasonable. reasonable, it sounds reasonable. to you that sound reasonable?
START but in all the confusion i.
START it in bela's office i think i left.
START somewhere. i am certain not.
START you are certain of what not?
START my communicator i left.
START you really think, that serious, is it?
START how you mean?
START lieutenant uhura, go, let us.
START transporter malfunction, must it be.
START rough trip, that was.
START this is the craziest landing pad, ever seen, have i.
START trinary sun, that is.
START to bridge scott.
START reversed controls have you?
START of you hurt either?
START i think not so, captain.
START there, captain. now, prepared for your training, you are.
START how know you our names?
START expecting you, the providers were, captain. your transportation they arranged.
START of yours these providers, are they.
START correction, captain. ours the providers are not. theirs, we are theirs.
START what they want from us?
START no, doctor. show up on our sensors, even that would.
START where then are they?
START your quarters, these are. open, thralls.
START they are within the confines of this solar system not.
START the odds are good not.
START no. say approximately four hundred, i would.
START your drill thrall i am. called lars i am.
START what want you from her?
START it is allowed to refuse selection not.
START interesting. to be an ionisation trail it seems.
START account for that, what would, spock?
START you, been selected for me, you have?
START very kind of you, that is, miss, but.
START nourishment, it is nourishment. it that we call.
START nourishment. very practical that is. what call you this collar?
START only to warn and punish, is it.
START how work it does he?
START it is permitted to talk of that not.
START you provide all my nourishment, will?
START that mean, what does?
START it means, a very beautiful woman, you are.
START beautiful, what is?
START born? been here always, i have.
START your parents. they, where are? your mother and father.
START killed in a freestyle match, she who bore me was.
START learn all these things, you will.
START ridiculous, this is. nothing out there, there is. nothing at all.
START to be heading into an empty sector we certainly seem.
START that, two dozen light years away, must be.
START allowed to refuse a training exercise it is not.
START do it, none of us will, galt.
START part of your training, it is. the providers wish it.
START with the providers the devil.
START pretty fast with that whip, he is.
START free people, we are. to no one we belong.
START always possible to miss something, is it.
START as a failure in the transporter mechanism such?
START no, sir. no sign of failure, there was.
START the way that is.
START their voices sound mechanical. computers are they?
START seen them, you have. bodies, do they have?
START as ours not such.
START this place, what is?
START it is used not.
START bodies, they do have, or did have.
START one talks of such things not.
START very pretty country. much like my home planet very, earth.
START looked at them, i have.
START one live on a flicker of light, how can?
START dark? but lighted, all is. here, the chambers.
START one do, what else would?
START love, what is?
START your words are allowed i think not.
START and this. this also helping is?
START call it that, you could.
START for me doctor mccoy speaks, too, sir.
START agreed. mister scott, manage warp seven could you?
START disturbed about what happened today, you are.
START this is kill our romance going to.
START to triskelion welcome, gentlemen.
START true, what the voice said was, sir. functioning, nothing is.
START but afraid, you are.
START an unproductive purpose, it is, of your intellect unworthy.
START for true gamesters not.
START three against one? pretty high odds, those are.
START your, unfair, your terms are.
START well, in that case, accept your terms, will i.
START yes, clear, that is.
START this, what in the name of heaven is?
START with this, heaven's got very little to do.
START you lied. you said everything.
START trained will the thralls be?
START i understand, little. leave us now, you will?
START to the lights in the sky to go back?
START then me how teach, and follow you, i will.
START one parsec, sir. to smell them close enough.
START making a little joke i was, sir.
START mister spock, of the quadrant immediate past history?
START of disputed area analysis?
START burke, sir? so i think not. sure it was i am.
START oh, royal academy. well.
START to warp factor six go.
START code one emergency. disaster call, that is.
START but nothing there there is. just the station.
START my order, that was, captain.
START my assistant arne darvin, this is.
START and my first officer mister spock, this is.
START mister spock, made your point, you have.
START of course, captain, that, i realise that.
START what you mean?
START federation offence, misuse of the priority one channels is.
START to enterprise kirk.
START not, i guess not.
START waste time taking your shore leave i see you did not.
START this wheat but me does everybody know about?
START not everyone, captain. russian invention, is it.
START to polish the flame gems i use that.
START your price not at.
START it, what is? alive is it? may i hold it?
START oh, adorable, it is adorable. it, what is?
START it, what is? why, lovely lady, tribble, is it.
START oh, purring, it is purring. listen, purring, it is purring.
START only saying that it likes you, it is.
START selling them are you?
START what we are trying to decide right now, that is.
START he will bite not, he, will?
START still nothing, twice nothing is.
START my offer, that is.
START joke that is.
START done. when them, can i have?
START all right, what selling them for are you?
START in fact, sell you this one, i will.
START hey! eating my grain, is he.
START oh, not, i could not. could i?
START what trying to do are you, ruin the market?
START yes, it, what is?
START it on visual put, lieutenant.
START now, just lovely that is.
START yes, lieutenant, it, what is?
START the position of the klingon ship, what is?
START captain, mister lurry, have i.
START cancel red alert. beam right down, will we.
START both take steps to keep it that way, let us.
START you ever relax, do not?
START relaxing, i am relaxing.
START how long have, that thing, you had, lieutenant?
START well, in that case, bargain, you got.
START get this at the space station did you?
START you, pipe it down here will, mister chekov.
START yes, mister baris. i do for you, what can?
START kirk, swarming with klingons, this station is.
START captain, be, may i ask where you will?
START with a headache sickbay.
START bones, you got for a headache, what have?
START me guess let. klingons? baris?
START both. of these did uhura give you how many?
START but got, you have, er, eleven.
START how they? how they?
START fat tribble.
START no. bunch of hungry little tribbles, you get.
START tell them before they go i will, sir.
START are you going on shore leave not, scotty?
START ah, friend. you a charming little tribble can i offer?
START oh. of you other gents perhaps one?
START it away from me get.
START with that parasite get out of here.
START only a harmless little, he is.
START vodka, this is.
START invented by a little old lady from leningrad, it was.
START like those fuzzy things the earthers, they, do not?
START easy, lad. to be more forgiving you ought.
START take it easy, lad. to an opinion everybody's entitled.
START do it, do not, mister, and an order, that is.
START laddie, you think you should rephrase that, do not?
START i not know, sir.
START no, sir, not, i did not.
START i not know, sir.
START us, they insulted us, sir.
START been some insult, must have.
START you held? why did chekov start a fight want to?
START well, the klingon, sir. this off the record is?
START no, off the record this is not.
START and they said you then.
START the picture, get i, scotty.
START no, not, i did not. to avoid trouble you told us.
START it they said that started the fight, what was?
START i see. and that is when you hit the klingons?
START well, sir, matter of pride, this was.
START something disquieting about these creatures, there is.
START tell me you have got a feeling, do not.
START that, what is, doctor?
START them better than i like you i like.
START one redeeming characteristic, they do have.
START i know, but really.
START of course. what say did you?
START serious charge, that is. to whom referring are you?
START cyrano jones, klingon agent?
START you, i heard you.
START he simply could believe his ears not.
START what evidence do, against mister jones, you have?
START yes, yes. go on. what else have do you?
START but after my grain, is he!
START any proof of that, you have?
START deny he is disrupted this station, you cannot.
START of the air vents probably through one.
START plenty, if happened, what i think's happened has.
START yes, sir. get in, nothing could.
START it is working not, sir. to be stuck it seems.
START here. me try it let.
START to be gorged they seem.
START of thousands hundreds.
START assuming they got here three days ago, that is.
START he tells me now.
START dead, captain this tribble is. and these, so are.
START really, captain kirk, protest this treatment, i must.
START ah, mister jones, with an armful. few questions.
START what you want?
START can, those things out of here, you get?
START in the bar, what was?
START very perceptive creatures, obviously tribbles are, captain.
START oh, yes. poisoned, it was poisoned.
START essentially it that is.
START mister darvin, are you talk going to?
START and with it, the tribbles had nothing to do?
START you know, i think, learn to like tribbles, could i.
START well, captain, free to go now i i suppose am.
START twenty years in a rehabilitation colony, the penalty is.
START one thing you can do, there is.
START take years, it would.
START it job security consider.
START captain, hard man, you are. all right! all right!
START do it, you will?
START do it, he will.
START do it i will.
START captain, able to divert that freighter, starfleet was.
START and you will find a tribble on this entire ship not.
START bones, how do it did you?
START scotty! the tribbles, where are?
START oh, er, captain, really mister spock's recommendation, it was.
START well, mister scott who performed the actual engineering, was it.
START mister scott. the tribbles, where are?
START they, where are?
START to the klingons i gave them, sir.
START captain, i think, going to like argelius, am i.
START of good taste obviously a man.
START like her do you, scotty?
START aye. i why should not?
START scotty, scotty. they use the lights in argelius.
START of our pillows have one?
START never a word, but dying to learn, i am.
START or handsome gentleman. we why not?
START physically, all right, is he. am i right in assuming that?
START he seems, overcoming his resentment, is he.
START oh yes. i know the place. go, let us.
START dead, she is dead, jim.
START stabbed, dozen times.
START just as shocked as you are, we are, mister hengist.
START native of argelius you are not, sir?
START i, i not remember.
START really, sir. hardly helpful that is.
START scotty, got to remember, you have.
START by any chance that scotty you think not.
START it makes not any difference what i think.
START but you just not throw him to the wolves.
START but suffering from a severe concussion, he is.
START do what we can, we will.
START love, the law of argelius is.
START and my wife, this is, sybo.
START of this you know?
START to enterprise kirk.
START as ordered lieutenant karen tracy reporting, captain.
START if just follow me, you will, lieutenant.
START of course, another possibility, there is.
START ready are you, sybo?
START ready, i am ready. may, the knife, have i, please?
START but it here i put when we arrived. gone, it is gone.
START dead, she is dead, jim. like the other one just.
START over and over again stabbed.
START lieutenant? captain? where is.
START dead? but i.
START be, it could be, jim. that head injury.
START picked, locks can be, jim.
START they been during the past few minutes where've?
START captain, if please you mind not.
START been another murder, there is, hengist. of my crew one.
START as kara the same.
START please, i know nothing about it. i did kill anyone not.
START well, the girl killed, how was?
START stabbed. and no sign of the weapon there is.
START if facilities i only had.
START this true is? you, who are?
START know kara did you?
START very disquieting that is.
START often been a motive for murder, jealousy has.
START prefect, kill anyone i did not. not, i could not.
START see, we shall see, morla.
START you prove you went directly home can?
START captain, with the questions please may i continue?
START with it well get on, man. there just stand not.
START ready, i am ready, jaris.
START what you suggest, mister spock?
START normally, no, but his head could that blow on.
START unproven, that is, sir.
START prove it, we can, if insane, he is insane.
START gentlemen, please. any man do such monstrous things, how could?
START what we hope to find out, that is, sir.
START you, sir, to remember nothing about the murders claim.
START remain, no doubt will.
START mister scott, you take the stand, will?
START to account for periods of functional amnesia sufficient abnormalities?
START captain, how that can be i see not.
START of memory unless scotty's lying about his loss.
START all right, scotty, have it let us.
START no, captain. sure of, i that am.
START scotty, to me lie. you, how old are?
START two other women murdered, there were.
START mister scott. kill kara did you?
START remember i not.
START kill lieutenant tracy did you?
START i not remember.
START waste of time, this is.
START to the entire procedure i object.
START prefect, you mean well i know, but had experience, have i.
START you at the time that kara was murdered, where were?
START i am sure not. walking home, i assume. angry, i was angry.
START kill lieutenant tracy did you?
START kill sybo did you?
START documented fact, sensitivity of certain argelian women is, captain.
START she said something else, make sense words that did not.
START computer, linguistic bank. of following word definition. redjac.
START no such word in the linguistics bank, there is?
START working. affirmative. proper name.
START ridiculous, that is. of years ago he lived hundreds.
START survive all these centuries a man could not.
START it feeds on death sybo said.
START computer, of such entity extrapolate most likely composition.
START affirmative. precedent, mellitus, of alpha majoris one cloud creature.
START seems likely not, does it?
START captain, aligned directly between argelius and earth, those places are.
START from rigel four, you come.
START well, many people do. crime it is not.
START not, i will not.
START and unaccounted for, you were when lieutenant tracy was murdered.
START computer. of exhibit a report on analysis.
START specify. of origin point.
START now then, mister hengist.
START dead, he is dead, jim.
START but impossible, that is.
START no use, is it, captain. blocked, the bypass circuits are.
START prove very interesting, that should.
START turning back we are. warp five, helm.
START warp five, sir. for capella four on course.
START registered in this sector, the carolina is.
START ignore it, lieutenant. as my order log it, my responsibility.
START scotty, if turn out to be real, it should.
START me with a rock my patient spattered. gone, she is gone.
START go with you, i will.
START to planet estimating?
START drawing a line, to step over it daring us.
START still closing. of flight the alien's directly in our line.
START ready, phaser banks are, sir.
START the earthmen make excellent game. surprised me, their cleverness has.
START dead. as they slept i killed them.
START if true, to them take us.
START first, verify her story, will we.
START this what your sworn word means is, klingon?
START just one thing i want, there is.
START get him, one of us must.
START it there hold. your weapons drop.
START you, we missed you, mister scott.
START well, at any rate, prove interesting, this should.
START understand it ourselves we actually not, mister scott.
START doctor mccoy, nor does.
START named leonard james akaar, the child was?
START that vulcan salute go, how does?
START with your presence vulcan honours us. to serve, we come.
START doctor. my wife, my aides and she who is.
START prefer another guide, i would, captain.
START captain, my parents, ambassador sarek and his wife are.
START with so little provocation humans smile.
START changed the situation between my father and myself has not.
START mister spock. moment, if you please.
START mrs. sarek, understand i just not.
START amanda. i am afraid you could pronounce the vulcan name not.
START like a command it sounded more.
START of course. vulcan, he is. his wife, am i.
START and his son, spock is.
START my best officer, spock is, and my friend.
START both stubborn, they are.
START human trait, captain?
START no! you! how you vote, of vulcan sarek?
START for reasons tellarites argue not. argue, they simply argue.
START correct, you are, captain. quite logical.
START met gav before have you, ambassador?
START my last council session we debated during. ambassador.
START sort of a fat teddy bear, is it.
START teddy bear?
START teddy bear.
START answer a hail does she?
START this quadrant except ours starfleet records no authorised vessel in.
START to guess what she is care?
START guess, captain? for my estimate i shall need more data.
START also human, he is.
START starfleet officer, he is.
START approve of starfleet i thought you did not.
START interesting. travelling at approximately warp ten, they were.
START vulcan, speak to you, would i.
START seem unavoidable, it does.
START how vote you on the coridan admission?
START well for you, that is. no mining interest, vulcan has.
START been carrying coridan dilithium crystals, some of your ships have.
START understood. payment for your slander will there be, sarek.
START illogical, threats are. and usually expensive, payment is.
START to captain kirk security.
START he killed, how was?
START broken, his neck was. by an expert.
START who aboard, that knowledge, would have?
START vulcans approve not of violence.
START have done it you are saying he could not?
START of me you want something, captain?
START ambassador, the tellarite. been murdered, gav has.
START yes. ambassador, you during the past hour, where were?
START captain, you are accusing him not?
START agree, i quite agree.
START then you during the hour, where were?
START very convenient excuse, that is, ambassador.
START you help him can?
START that yet either i know not.
START sorry about your father, i am.
START yes, adversely affect our mission, could it.
START you worried about him are not?
START one of theirs, i think it unlikely it is.
START the intruder ship, it is, sir.
START to mister spock's station for decode switch recorder, lieutenant.
START possibly, captain. but decode this transmission, i cannot.
START bones, he, how is?
START why did you tell me not?
START done could there was nothing you have.
START ambassador, when these attacks, you did have?
START no witnesses, there were?
START doctor, propose surgery for the heart defect do you?
START because of the vulcan heart of the construction.
START other vulcans aboard, there are.
START yes, say that is rare, i would.
START be possible to filter out the human factors, it should.
START indeed. estimate the odds, i would.
START it, i see it, spock, but rigelian, that was.
START very similar to vulcan, rigelian physiology is.
START good enough similar is not. still experimental, it is.
START but look promising, it does.
START what drug, doctor? asleep, my husband is. what drug?
START already pulled. perfectly healthy, you are, mister spock.
START that got, what has.
START seem the only answer, would it.
START in the brig questioning the andorian prisoner, i will be.
START turn command over to scotty, you can.
START spock, turn command over to somebody else, you must.
START duty? to your father, your duty is.
START as important as your father's life, nothing is.
START oh, to him go. now. please.
START no, my head the one inside. i, how long have.
START not good. if only operate, i could.
START what's stopping you? all ready, i thought you were.
START jim, if you stand, start to bleed again, you could.
START captain, quite all right are you?
START get out, spock. chekov, of the intruder what's the status?
START to the bridge call mister scott.
START captain, moving closer, the alien vessel is.
START belay that order. stay here, will i.
START security? to the brig security. search the prisoner immediately.
START where do you think, going, you are?
START see the captain, i must.
START so your father's life is.
START moving away. turning now. coming around again, he is.
START as he passes fire, ensign.
START clean miss, sir.
START his weaponry report on, mister chekov.
START coming around again, he is.
START full spread missed, sir. moving too fast for us, they are.
START off, the systems are.
START sickbay systems put on priority, call engineering and have.
START buckled, number four shield has, sir.
START intended from the beginning, that was, captain.
START andorian you are not. you, who are?
START gone, number two shield is.
START your own answers find, captain. long to live you have not.
START what doing are you?
START no. your phasers stand by, mister chekov.
START looking us over. dead as far as he knows, we are.
START baiting him, you are. trying to lure him in, you are.
START he comes here. range decreasing. to sublight speed dropping close.
START your fire hold, mister chekov.
START to sickbay take him.
START miscalculated, i seem to have.
START quite through shaking the ship around are you?
START spock, they, sarek how are?
START all the luck, some doctors have.
START captain, find the alien, i believe you will.
START find he is an orion, i think you will, doctor.
START but they gain by an attack on starfleet, what would?
START had something else on your mind might you have.
START no, but you anyway thank.
START understand i not.
START for your life saving.
START emotional, she is not?
START always been that way, she has.
START indeed? why marry her did you?
START at the time, to do it seemed the logical thing.
START doctor, return to my station now, i will.
START at your station, you are, mister spock.
START doctor mccoy, enjoying all this, i believe you are.
START indeed, captain. never seen him look so happy, i have.
START she, how is, doc?
START to the starfleet small thanks.
START now really, commissioner, blame the starfleet you cannot.
START received the proper inoculations ahead of time, i should have.
START you check your automatic scanner, will, please?
START odd, that is. never seen anything like that before, i have.
START i, nor have.
START with us staying right. sensor readings, mister spock.
START got it we have.
START helm answers not, captain.
START what's happening? to know i demand.
START i insist, your scheduled rendezvous with the enterprise, you make.
START to stay inside just how long am i supposed, captain?
START reason must there be.
START look a little further, let us.
START bones, get a physiological reading on that, it is whatever.
START real enough, we are.
START vulcan, you are, are you not?
START human, he is human, jim. everything checks out perfectly.
START well, know anything about that i would not.
START you mind not if we continue to try?
START go right ahead. got plenty of time, you have.
START what about you, cochrane? how get here did you?
START to notice i needed one how perceptive of you.
START talks a lot, but he says much not.
START noticed something else, have i.
START familiar, he looks familiar.
START familiar? you mention it now that, he does.
START quite place him, i cannot, but. what about miss hedford?
START you keep it so terribly hot in here must?
START feel hot do you?
START infuriated, i feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged.
START rest later, i will, doctor.
START yes, i know. it means, running out of time, are we.
START that, what was?
START nothing to explain there is.
START all right. the companion, was it.
START injured, you were?
START dying, i was dying, mister spock.
START you seem perfectly all right now. the matter, what was?
START an old man, i was.
START what, you were?
START pretty far out story, that is.
START mister cochrane, first name, you have?
START right, that is, captain.
START is your story a little improbable not, mister cochrane?
START true, never found, his body was.
START looking at it, you are, mister spock.
START how you feel?
START terrible. i feel, how should?
START running a little temperature, you are. lie down, perhaps you should.
START we have, how long do?
START of hours a matter, all that is.
START i have aged not. to that the companion sees.
START know, i already know.
START mind telling us you would not?
START you will like it not.
START i already like not it.
START here to keep me company, you are.
START you brought us here you mean?
START begin to age again, i would, normally.
START do you leave here want to?
START got it, you have.
START i said, very powerful, was it.
START it cure her could?
START know i not.
START how communicate you with it?
START how do you it?
START of clear my mind and it comes i just sort.
START bones, what make you of that?
START of some kind almost a symbiosis, of joining a sort.
START no, more than that, it is.
START agreed. like love more.
START all right are you?
START do anything to help miss hedford the companion cannot.
START then die, she will die.
START spock! all right are you?
START you, it attacked you?
START you, it troubles you, cochrane?
START also keeping you prisoner, it is.
START i want not it killed.
START it powerless we may simply render.
START of view i suppose from your point, right, you are.
START all right. to contact it you want me?
START it ours nor.
START that, what kind of talk is?
START your fault it is not.
START for use with more congruent life forms, the translator is.
START of residual matter floating around there'd still be traces, lieutenant.
START as she goes steady, mister sulu.
START what think you it means, mister scott?
START this course we stay on, see what comes up.
START big galaxy, it is, mister scott.
START this device what's the theory behind?
START yes. change the entire situation, the matter of gender could.
START way ahead of you, i am.
START then zookeeper it is not.
START but i heard.
START understand i not.
START what, i am?
START what complaining about are you? you alive it kept.
START that thing fed on me. me, it used me. disgusting, it is disgusting.
START as bad as it is, you are.
START fascinating. totally parochial attitude.
START him, i heard him. loved and he resents it, he was.
START companion, love the man do you?
START understand i not.
START part of me, he is. continue, the man must.
START he ages not. forever, he remains forever.
START understand i not.
START what hope to gain by that did you, jim?
START useless, it is useless. i know.
START take some explaining that'll, bones.
START too late. of this all, just an illusion.
START no illusion. dead, jackson is. to enterprise kirk. come in.
START to beam up five.
START you pinpoint it any closer can, lieutenant?
START sir, picking up a ship's disaster beacon, am i.
START to raise it try, lieutenant.
START no answer, captain. all, is the automatic beacon, get i.
START sensors recording normal energy output not.
START the constellation, is it. look at that.
START red alert. red alert. your battle stations man.
START going to board her we are. mister spock, in command, you are.
START out, filtration systems are, sir.
START what think you did it, sir?
START abducted the crew was not, left, they just left. to enterprise kirk.
START continue our search, will we. kirk out.
START exhausted. they did give up without a battle not.
START matt. matt, jim kirk, is it.
START kirk. jim kirk, it is.
START to your ship what happened, matt?
START ship. attacked. that, that thing.
START what thing? it, what was?
START answer me! it, what was? what happened, matt?
START with the duplicate log ready, sir.
START to your crew what happened?
START matt, your crew, where is?
START no third planet, there is.
START captain, our report, washburn has.
START what look like does it?
START both or neither. i not know.
START to raise starfleet command due to heavy subspace interference unable.
START robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. why?
START we not know. an alien race, apparently from another galaxy.
START bones, ever hear of a doomsday machine did you?
START no. doctor, i am, not a mechanic.
START oh, no, here, i stay here. leaving my ship i am not!
START closing on us, is it, mister spock.
START to beam ready, sir.
START mister spock, communication's damaged. unable to override interference, we are.
START i, repair warp drive without a spacedock, cannot.
START no casualties, mister spock. we doing, how are?
START outrun it we have, doctor.
START carry out my last order, you will, mister sulu.
START that thing, destroyed, must be.
START let him do this you cannot, spock.
START doctor, out of line, you are.
START certify that right now, will i.
START then be considered valid your statement would not.
START what about the captain? leave, we cannot leave.
START captain, fused solid, the impulse engines' control circuits are.
START helmsman, your course hold. stand by all phaser banks.
START to give it a try ready?
START scotty, you doing how?
START it now try, captain.
START washburn, to engineering get down. assist mister scott.
START but you understand, do not? got to destroy it, we have!
START break loose, we cannot!
START we have got it not. being pulled inside we are.
START scotty, me that power give.
START it that is, mister scott. keep that power coming.
START aye, sir. move we still cannot.
START it on keep pouring, scotty.
START captain, what we are doing i still know not.
START phasers? got 'em, you have. one bank recharged i have.
START loose, we are loose, commodore.
START closing fast on the constellation, is it.
START commodore, i suggest.
START moving away, are we, commodore.
START closing with us again, is it, sir.
START mister spock, pierced the interference locally, we have.
START you raise starfleet can?
START matt. what's going on? me mister spock give.
START in command here, i am, jim.
START nothing. to regulations i assumed command according.
START speaking to a senior officer, you are, kirk.
START me spock give.
START to repair warp drive how long?
START gaining on us, is it, sir.
START mister spock, relieve commodore decker immediately. direct order, that is.
START commodore decker, relieved of command, you are.
START your authority to relieve me i recognise not.
START captain, assumed command, i have.
START accompany the commodore to sickbay, you will.
START fine. of it just make sure you stay ahead.
START it going keep, scotty, it going keep. mister spock.
START too late, is it, sir.
START to enterprise kirk. why launching a shuttlecraft are you?
START to shuttlecraft enterprise. come in, shuttlecraft.
START to enterprise shuttlecraft. decker here.
START commodore, insist that you return to the ship, i must.
START kirk, this is. matt, killed will you be.
START stronger with you than without you, are we!
START gone, he is gone. constellation, come in, please.
START regrettable that he died for nothing, it is.
START mister spock, now operational, the transporter is.
START transporter operational, captain. beam you aboard shall we?
START little to be gained by staying aboard the constellation, there is.
START insufficient data. to take further sensor readings i shall try.
START spock, know you not?
START captain, getting dangerously close to the planet killer, you are.
START jim, killed will you be, like decker just.
START calculated risk, mister spock.
START very slim timing, thirty seconds is.
START chance, have to take, will i. kirk out.
START understood. mister spock. to beam scotty on board prepare.
START with that thing what's the matter?
START power drain somewhere, it is, sir. i almost lost you.
START out, transporter is, captain. have to stand by, you will.
START i cannot. power level's dropping too fast. better hurry, you would.
START to beam me aboard on my signal prepare.
START me aboard beam.
START energising. bridge, shorted out again, it is.
START och, with it what's wrong?
START gentlemen, me aboard beam.
START mister scott, to detonation twenty seconds.
START sixty, fifty, forty.
START gentlemen, me aboard i suggest you beam.
START her now try, mister kyle.
START bridge, him through, got we!
START your readings start.
START spectacular, it is spectacular, is it not?
START shame to have to intrude, it is.
START sure about that are you?
START me homesick it makes. like russia just.
START of eden more like the garden, ensign.
START what did somebody say? like this that paradise must've looked?
START aye, captain. shame about hendorff, it is.
START it, what is?
START but you say, nothing to worry about, there is?
START well, sir, i did exactly say that not.
START nice down there, i hear it is.
START indeed. for miles in all directions subsurface vibrations.
START it, what is?
START it, what is, mister spock?
START about to take some readings, i was.
START it is whatever, like a cat it moves.
START jim, this i like not.
START of eden garden, with land mines.
START to captain kirk enterprise.
START i could stop it not, but why, i know why.
START heading there now, are we, scotty. you need any help?
START nothing you can do about it, there is, sir.
START of generator some kind?
START to find in paradise peculiar stuff.
START to enterprise kirk.
START spock. all right are you?
START just what you think you were trying to do?
START unaware of that plant, i surmised you were, so i.
START so, i shall do.
START one hundred twenty two thousand two hundred.
START thirty seconds ago, cloud in the sky there was not.
START over there, is it! that way! i never saw anything like.
START jim, have stopped any of this you could not.
START me get into the academy his father helped.
START captain. in each case, unavoidable, this was.
START prevented all of it could i have.
START i see not how.
START mister chekov, totally inefficient, your tricorder readings are!
START what you want, violence?
START the eyes of vaal, am i. see, he must see.
START vaal, who is?
START vaal, vaal is. everything, he is everything.
START name, do you have?
START captain, fascinating, this is. if permit me, you will, sir?
START of the people of vaal you speak. nearby are they?
START to captain kirk enterprise.
START aye, sir. all, is impulse power, have we.
START it on maximum put. full emergency circuits.
START all on, are they, captain.
START no, sir. slipping, we are slipping.
START i will do everything, to do, there is, sir. scott out.
START me about vaal tell.
START to him take me. to speak to him i wish.
START take my chances, i will.
START but the centre this is not, mister spock.
START force field?
START akuta, how talk you to vaal?
START when get hungry does he?
START the people of vaal, these are.
START the others, where are?
START no others, there are.
START children? to me you use unknown words.
START like yourselves little ones. they grow.
START replacements. necessary, none are. forbidden by vaal, are they.
START love. strange words. children. love. love, what is?
START love is when two people are.
START ah, yes. the holding, the touching. forbidden this, vaal has.
START to vaal welcome.
START well, thank you. something for you, it does.
START yes, it does indeed, captain. me uncomfortable it makes.
START sayana, i am sayana. name, you have?
START yes. spock. spock, i am spock.
START to see what they find so amusing i fail.
START nothing makes sense down here. to enterprise kirk.
START sir, doing everything within engineering reason we are.
START that is the way not.
START my view in, of reciprocity a splendid example.
START maintain did it, scotty?
START cutting it a bit fine, that is, scotty.
START yeoman, wasting energy, you are.
START captain, trapped, we are trapped,
START sit down, and to eat have something.
START up there, the enterprise is.
START need a replacement, would they. opinion, mister spock?
START from a machine? like to see i that would.
START i understand, vaal. it, done, shall be.
START together is paradise can any place we be.
START know i not.
START we be able to get back aboard, will?
START no, not if, with me, you are.
START why look you like that?
START they touched the way. understand i not.
START pleasant, it is pleasant, makora.
START yes. this way they touched in.
START vaal! angry, he is angry.
START kill, akuta? we not understand.
START it going how's, scotty?
START that, i know that. as you said, cutting things fine, that is.
START kirk out. it, what is?
START disturbing. disappeared, the people of vaal seem to have.
START get out of here, let us!
START second degree burns. not serious, but bet they smart, i will.
START doctor, an unsurpassed talent for understatement, you have.
START captain, doing it we are. pulling away we are!
START no good, is it, sir. only a few systems responding, there is.
START fired, you are. four hundred people.
START to ring the dinner bell fine time.
START scotty, still have phaser power do you?
START aye, but what.
START aye, sir, but penetrate that force field they will not.
START assume so i would.
START good. see how long he can do it, let us.
START no power generation at all, captain. dead, vaal is.
START tractor beam gone. to antimatter pods potency returning.
START children, what are?
START i agree not with you at all, mister spock.
START unusual that is not, doctor.
START jim, to hear this i want you.
START captain, aware of the biblical story of genesis, you are.
START no, mister spock. think you would be i did not.
START to beam up landing party stand by.
START but not, we will not. consider that. enterprise. transporter room, energise.
START right, spock was. rough trip, was it.
START of mission status, captain?
START be tolerated carelessness with the equipment cannot.
START but mister spock, i.
START no, mister spock! i tried. tried, i really tried.
START to your error due, mister kyle?
START captain, all this, what is?
START how did we get in these.
START i not know. our enterprise but it is not, it is. maybe.
START when materialised, we first materialised.
START another captain kirk, another doctor mccoy, another.
START an exchange. if here, we are here.
START what about the halkans? let them be destroyed we cannot.
START mister chekov, for planetary target a phaser setting.
START still no interest, uhura? hmm? change your mind i could.
START away from your post, you are, mister.
START authorisation from security, do you have, sir?
START have to check with security chief sulu, i will, sir.
START never mind. attend to it, i will.
START to new firing position shall i correct orbit?
START to secondary city lock on.
START our phaser lock secondary target now moving beyond.
START of orders a serious breach, captain.
START useless to resist us, it is.
START twelve hours to consider your position, you have.
START twelve hours, captain? unprecedented, that is.
START at liberty to do so, you are, mister spock.
START yes, your job, he did.
START smart boy, to the top dog switching.
START of here get him out.
START all right. working for me, you are.
START in line, you are. you might even make captain.
START my ship not on.
START for this one the booth, sir?
START security chief, mister sulu is, like the ancient gestapo.
START mostly variations in instrumentation. handle, nothing i cannot.
START be, everything's exactly where it should, except us.
START find out where we stand, let us. computer.
START record procedure. scotty, it, can you do?
START doctor i am, not an engineer.
START find out let us. computer.
START of current command read out official record.
START captain? do it, we can.
START our enterprise on.
START answer none of your questions at this time, can i.
START i have decided not.
START i said i have decided not.
START spock, think we should destroy the halkans do you?
START release chekov. to quarters confine him.
START to hold him for about six hours that ought.
START preoccupied, i was preoccupied.
START further than that, if successful, i am successful.
START and not, if i do?
START i intend not to kill him.
START no, but avoid killing spock, i will.
START get out of his way, will i.
START this thing i hate.
START that bad it is not.
START well, if advantage of your opportunities you take not.
START how does marlena fit in want to?
START got another deadline, we have, too, sir.
START in progress, a security research is.
START conducting the research, who is?
START the nature of the research, what is?
START classified under voice index log, programme is.
START why monitoring my communications are you, mister sulu?
START working on escape or defence, he is.
START my concern, that is.
START do, i still do.
START got to go, have i.
START you have not to do that.
START the captain's woman until he says you are not, you are.
START getting bored i was. of course this is the time not.
START afraid i changed my mind, am i. again.
START take much chances you, lieutenant.
START mister scott, all clear. to sickbay on my way.
START up to the captain, it now is.
START your movements restrict, captain.
START shoot. wasting time, you are.
START running a big risk, you are, spock.
START much time how, scotty?
START get home we will. take long this will not.
START this, what is, mister sulu?
START captain, barely got ten minutes, we have.
START go, let us, bones.
START it, i guarantee it. now, go on, please.
START working, it is working, sir.
START but only three of you, there are.
START if you kill us, still stay, you will.
START mccoy where is? time, scotty.
START do you know what, do to me, will they?
START the power's cut, sir. on to us, are they.
START aye, available, it is available.
START to your setup can you bridge?
START have to stay, one of us will.
START stay, i will stay, captain.
START to the transporter chamber get. you, too, uhura.
START an order, that is, scotty.
START man of integrity in both universes, you are, mister spock.
START the empire, overthrown, shall be, of course.
START one minute and twenty three seconds, you have.
START one man, summon the future, cannot.
START in sickbay, the body is.
START me sickbay show.
START show you, doctor mccoy will.
START told you that without looking could i have.
START the lot of you staring at me for, what are?
START all right, it is.
START to lieutenant uhura that thing did something!
START scotty, being taken care of, is she. all right, is it.
START what do to me did it?
START explain it to you, doctor mccoy will.
START nurse, for a full physical examination i want him prepared.
START you restored scott. much more extensive damage, he had.
START to wait elsewhere does the creator wish nomad?
START laugh that is.
START the study of of great use would it be, captain.
START also one of your biological units, mister spock is, creator?
START your instructions follow, nomad.
START down, my screens are.
START it out sound.
START she doing how's?
START with that thing get into direct mental contact?
START to uhura you saw what it did.
START permit it i will, creator.
START what mean does it, nomad, we are nomad?
START then it is nomad not?
START your pardon i beg?
START how doing that are you?
START your dampers throw.
START your circuits cut, of them all.
START impossible. go that fast, it cannot.
START stop it just will not, mister scott. warp eleven!
START nomad, stop what, doing, you are. scotty?
START acknowledged. reversed as ordered, is it, creator.
START mister scott, her there give sulu warp two and keep.
START of my you killed two.
START creator, inefficient, your biological units are.
START programmed to investigate, am i.
START foolish mistake, was it.
START i believe not there is much beyond nomad's capabilities.
START find the earth infested with imperfect biological units, will it.
START and carry out its prime directive, it will. sterilise.
START all right is she?
START so, i think so. of shock looks like some kind.
START been blocked, manual override has. source, engineering.
START get scotty, me in engineering some antigravs and meet.
START programmed to obey the orders of your creator, you are.
START perfect, i am perfect. nomad, i am nomad.
START but your creator, i am.
START the creator, you are.
START you, i created you?
START the creator, you are.
START answer unknown. analyse, i shall analyse.
START sterilise in case of error, you must?
START inconsistent with my prime functions, error is. correction, sterilisation is.
START in error must be sterilised that everything is.
START no exceptions, there are.
START no error, the creation of perfection is.
START create perfection i did not. error, i created error.
START faulty, your data is. nomad, i am nomad. perfect, i am perfect.
START the kirk, i am, the creator?
START the creator, you are.
START flawed and imperfect, you are! your prime function execute!
START impeccable, your logic was, captain. in grave danger, we are.
START nomad, imperfect, you are!
START your prime function exercise.
START my congratulations, captain. of logic a dazzling display.
START lieutenant, this morning you look a bit tired.
START even from here, tell his pulse rate's up, can i.
START sure i like that i am not, jim.
START actually, losing an officer, am i.
START it, what is, mister spock? hand is it?
START trick, then? projection?
START not a projection, sir. of energy a field.
START hard about. seem to get away from it we cannot.
START almost as if it means to grab us, it is.
START dead still, we are, captain. helm answers not. move, we cannot move.
START lieutenant, to starbase twelve immediately relay our position and circumstances.
START applying thrust, sir. no results, captain. stuck tight, we are.
START captain, most curious development on scanner five seven.
START all take a look at it, let us, mister spock.
START responsible for stopping the ship are you?
START it back give, then talk, we will talk.
START all right! whatever, doing, you are, it off turn! you win!
START gone, pressure is, captain. space normal on hull.
START go, let us, bones. you in good voice?
START sure, wise, is it, jim?
START verbose, is he not?
START present, insults are effective only where emotion is.
START going to need help in all those areas, we are.
START of earth you know? been there, you have?
START and the tsar of all the russias, am i.
START sorry, i am sorry, captain. i never met a god before.
START and you have yet not. readings, doctor.
START so simple evidently not.
START leave this place you will not.
START i will permit that device to work not, either, captain.
START what you want is it?
START worship me, you will, as your fathers did before you.
START worship me, i said you would.
START and got a lot to learn, you have!
START to break through it try, lieutenant.
START analysis. lieutenant palamas, what know you about apollo?
START he is whatever, to control a remarkable technology he seems.
START bones, i wonder if five thousand years ago.
START theory, you have?
START an idea, i have. really apollo, what if he is?
START your name i mean.
START her alone leave.
START and you, so do.
START grown weary of discussion and argument i have.
START captain, the phasers. fused, all the working parts are.
START oh, beautiful, it is beautiful.
START going with you she is not.
START all right, is it, captain. go, i will go.
START without fear. fit indeed, is she.
START bones, he, how is?
START have been rather difficult to stop, he would.
START mister chekov, i think, better continue your investigation, you would.
START how you feel, scotty?
START seem so, it would.
START able, i am able, sir.
START scotty believes not in gods.
START to reverse polarity ready, mister sulu?
START to generate computed and standing by, sir.
START working, i am working, sir, but do anything with this i cannot.
START just picked up readings for our own people, have i, sir.
START seem to pinpoint it i cannot.
START oh, lovely, it is lovely.
START god, you really think you are?
START but die you said the others did not.
START i not understand.
START this boy spock's contaminating, jim.
START seem most likely that would, sir.
START to do number one on our list of things.
START to offer, is that all you have?
START bones, possible is it.
START lieutenant palamas, where is?
START no longer of any concern to you, is she.
START you bloodthirsty saracen, you done with her, what have?
START learn discipline, you will. learn, you will.
START chekov, me a hand give.
START all right are you, captain?
START like the cat in that russian story he disappeared again.
START you mean the english story, do not, the cheshire cat?
START cheshire? no, sir. minsk perhaps, but.
START how you feel?
START get my arm to move i cannot.
START got to get out of here, we have.
START i still say, get us killed, can it.
START essential, speed is, lieutenant.
START go! gather laurel leaves? joking, you must be!
START kill a deer. the funniest thing i ever heard, that is.
START of your insolence you shall reap the rewards!
START tired of your phony fireworks we are!
START mortal, earned this, you have!
START they worship you if you hurt them, how can?
START captain, got to do something we have!
START carolyn. to her what's happened?
START scotty, find out, will i.
START you, how old are?
START over there come. well?
START i not understand.
START spurn him. reject him. you must. special to him, you are.
START yes. him, i love him.
START yes. yes, i understand. calling me, is he.
START lieutenant. your orders and your duty, you have.
START yes, sir. my duty my orders and.
START of some sort near you is there a structure?
START indeed there is, mister spock.
START very good. how doing on the force field are you?
START captain. recommend a discreet distance, i would.
START well, it serves not any other purpose i know of.
START yes, i know. i know. scotty. wait, we will wait.
START apollo, i am apollo. chosen you, have i.
START it i believe not. you love me.
START that, what the devil is?
START picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area, sensors are.
START captain, got to go and find her, have we!
START got to be here, have we when he comes back.
START but not, what if he does. what if he.
START fire those phasers! an order, that is, mister spock!
START to the shields more power.
START had to do this i wish we had not.
START spock, it is spock. noticed anything strange about him have you?
START no, nothing in particular. why?
START all right, it is. carry on, miss chapel.
START bones, busy man, am i.
START spock, this all about, what the devil is?
START all right, spock, have it, let us.
START captain, enough leave time accumulated, surely i have.
START no. of that nature nothing, captain.
START spock, asking you i am. what's wrong?
START rest, i need rest. asking you to accept that answer, am i.
START to vulcan alter course. to warp four increase speed.
START over here put it on audio, lieutenant.
START mister chekov, for compliance compute course and speed necessary.
START understand, i quite understand, captain.
START diverting to vulcan put us, how far behind schedule will?
START mister spock. with me come, please.
START deck five. changed course for vulcan, you have, mister spock. why?
START deny it do you?
START no. no, by no means, captain. quite possible, is it.
START then it, why'd you do?
START trying to help you, am i, spock.
START me no further questions ask. i will answer not.
START to report to the sickbay i order you.
START come in, spock. all ready for you, i am.
START going to get space sick, i think i am.
START jim, got to get spock to vulcan, you have.
START he die, why must? why within eight days? explain.
START i not know.
START you say, convinced he knows what it is, you are?
START no, i not understand. explain. consider that an order.
START to do with biology, it has.
START of biology what kind?
START but you are a fish not, mister spock. you are.
START mister sulu, you not think.
START me alone let. me alone let!
START well, that that is.
START course already plotted. it in laying, sir.
START understand i not.
START wet, your face is.
START christine, my name is.
START oh, be very glad to do that i would, mister spock.
START permitted is it?
START honoured shall i be, sir.
START captain. standing by on vulcan hailing frequencies, we are, sir.
START spock, this is.
START lovely, she is lovely, mister spock. she, who is?
START t'pring, she is t'pring. my wife.
START lovely, it is lovely. cooler, i wish the breeze were.
START thinner than earth, the atmosphere is.
START the marriage party approaches. them, i hear them.
START marriage party? your wife, you said t'pring was.
START this important, he never mentioned that his family was.
START kirk, this is.
START it, what is? what happened?
START take him, think spock can?
START it, i doubt it. his present condition not in.
START no! to be the one, i am. agreed, it was agreed.
START forgiveness, i ask forgiveness.
START my friend understands not.
START to spock if i decline what happens?
START you, do it, cannot, jim.
START jim, listen, if you.
START what you mean, if both survive?
START going to have to kill him, you are, jim.
START to enterprise mccoy.
START over me i see no logic in preferring stonn.
