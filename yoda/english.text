START happened, what has? END
START been sent to ask if you require anything, i have. END
START you understand, do not? our duty. END

START captain christopher, my first officer, this is, lieutenant commander spock. END
START very well, mister spock. your mind anything else on? END
START your logic, most annoying, can be. END
START computer, address me in that manner you will not. compute. END
START an unfortunate tendency to giggle, it also has. END
START afraid you will have to, i am. we, send you back, cannot. END
START report, i would report, if i could. take the risk we cannot. END
START for his disposition recommendation, dear? END
START captain christopher. captain christopher? security, the captain, this is. END

START if going to get nasty, you are, going to leave, i am. END
START to forget his family could he be retrained? his children? END
START just a joke, is it, captain. END
START you said, some additional information, you had, mister spock? END
START my computations i made an error in. END
START oh? an historic occasion, could this be. END
START primitive computer. seen them demonstrated in museums i have. END
START to start it i intend not. END
START how long been down there now have they? END
START well, should they be coming up not? END
START that, what was? END
START what, what was? END

START that noise. coming from one of these things, is it. END
START you are stay right where. END
START know in a moment, we will, doctor. END
START spock here. all right are you, captain? END
START i believe not there'll be trouble in that respect, captain. END
START to remain where he is our guest seems quite satisfied. END
START try the darkroom, we will. END
START all right. the other one, where is? END
START no. nobody, been able to, should have. END
START quite correct, your decision to beam up was, mister sulu. END
START believe me, colonel, believe me you would not. END
START try to be funny, do not. how get in did you? END
START of thin air i popped in out. END
START no, colonel. i know, no game, is it. END

START for the fourth time, james t, my name is. kirk. END
START you, i told you, believe me you would not. END
START colonel, with that would you mind being careful? END
START sabotage something did i? END
START here for, is that what you are? nothing at all? END
START that is what would have happened if you had interfered not. END
START to be just about right that ought. END
START do that i cannot, captain. END
START if something went wrong. END
START in fact, i do. but to a certain point only. END
START do that all the time do they? END
START hungry are you? END
START you like, what would? END
START yes, i do. he doing here what's? END
START be a fool, do not. you know what's at stake. END
START explain your presence on the base you cannot. END
START go home, you will, christopher but, do it our way, you will. END
START i suspected he might wish to return with us not. END
START to beam up four, mister sulu. END
START maximum now, it is, sir. fighting it, she is. END
START broken free and heading back, have we. END
START to transporter room bridge. captain christopher. END
START coming up on earth fast, are we, captain. ready are you? END
START twenty minutes, sir. close will it be. END
START to transporter room bridge. to energise prepare. END
START be close enough for a visual contact, you should. END
START mirages we track not. END
START to transporter room bridge, to energise prepare. END
START our reading what's, mister spock? END
START our century approaching, captain. begin now, braking should. END
START to engineering bridge. begin full braking power. END
START to go fifty years. END
START still with us, mister scott is. END
START starfleet control, the enterprise, this is. captain kirk speaking. END
START starfleet control, repeating message. home, the enterprise is. kirk out. END

START good, commodore. on our way, are we. END

START clear, captain, but you. END
START never mind about me. my ship protect! END

START it, a lot closer to them, will be. stand clear. END
START me what happened can you tell? END
START orbit decaying, mister spock. to atmosphere ten seconds. END

START thank you, yeoman. sufficient, that is. END
START you need sleep, captain. if out of line it is not. END

START where get it did you, mister sulu? END
START doctor mccoy's rabbit, sir. gone through here, he must have. END

START finnegan? believe it i cannot. END
START all right, try that one again, let us. go! END
START it, what was? END

START captain, becoming emotional, you are. END
START or my part a tragic mistake on. END
START that i buy not, bones. guard! END
START it is there. END
START sure, you are? END
START of arrival estimated time, mister sulu? END
START contact, shall i make, sir? END
START planning something, you are, captain? END
START my guess unless i miss, friend demos, that is. END
START he attacks what if, sir? END
START but the hangar doors are open not, captain. END
START to the federation now i demand that you report! END
START i would, but out of communications range, we unfortunately are. END
START stowaway, you are, commander. END
START been tricked i have. END
START sure it is safe, you are, captain? END
START decidedly. difference, there is, captain. END
START ever been to i not the most enchanting place have. END
START of flowers plagues seldom leave behind fields, captain. END
START outsiders they like not. END
START an outsider surely you are not, commander. dramian, you are. END
START inhospitable or not, he must get away not. END
START disappeared, he is disappeared. almost as if he dematerialised, it is. END
START advise against that, i would, captain. END
START mind if i ignore your advice i am sure you will not. END
START seem to be advisable, caution would, captain. END
START on the line, bones' life is, mister spock. END
START cave dwellers? of your civilisation in the midst? END
START of your doctor mccoy and his inhumane methods a result. END
START you say it, demos, but not, that does. END
START but how survive the plague did he? END
START then tell us, you can. remember do you? END
START get underway for dramia let us. END
START sir, that, who is? END
START pour on the coal i will, captain. END
START hope the trial hasn't started, let us. END
START yes, mister spock. it, what is? END
START hardly fit to testify at the trial, he is, captain. END
START got to save him, have we. END
START it is that not. it is. END
START captain, blue, you are. END
START been activated, general order six has? END
START good. to sickbay report, mister sulu. END
START but sir, monitor, who will? END
START i assure you, capable, am i, mister sulu. END
START to get mccoy, have we. must find an antidote. END
START impossible. stricken, he too is. END
START to get mccoy got. END
START doctor, with me, just come, please. END
START plague? why did you tell me not? END
START doctor, i am, spock, doctor. get us beamed aboard. END
START blast it, spock, work harder. in the terminal stage, they are. END
START bones, it, that is. aurora, changing colour. END
START jim? aurora? what. END
START bones, it, you did! END
START and forget about a certain stowaway we will. END
START apologise, we must apologise. END
START that supposed to mean, what is? END
START hippocrates would have approved of lame excuses not, doctor. END
START captain, established contact with the romulan commander, i have. END
START for this unprovoked attack i demand an explanation. END
START strange. on the charts it is not. END
START mister spock, our chances, what are? END
START after that ride, use some repairs, i could. END
START the repairs progressing, how are, scotty? END
START how like you that? so did mine. END
START beginning to wonder, i am, bones, beginning to wonder i am. END
START you got there, what have, spock? END
START sorry, i am sorry, spock, your, it is your. END
START officer scott, will you join us for lunch not? END
START hey, wait a minute. we did cause this to happen not. END
START okay, gone far enough, this whole thing has! END
START when you all finish laughing, appreciate an explanation, i would. END
START captain, laugh, i never laugh. END
START no joke, this is, sir. END
START amazing. covered with ice, this deck is. END
START to one guilty party the evidence all points, captain. END
START you know who's behind these stunts you mean? END
START well, it be what'll, swim at the beach? END
START then it is woods. END
START ah, more like it, that now is. shall we? END
START strange, that is. repeat the call. END
START so peaceful, it is. so relaxing. END
START and of all best, no practical jokes. END
START that, what was? END
START i am sure not. like someone chuckling it almost sounded. END
START there, again, is it. definitely laughing at us, someone is. END
START hear that right, did i? END
START never tell i will. END
START well, be, i will be. END
START compliance, i suggest compliance, captain. END
START with sugar on say pretty please. END
START temper, temper. cool you off, perhaps this will. END
START for a nap time, old girl. captain's orders. END
START vacate sir? but. END
START you bloody big scatterbrain. your monumental mind make up. END
START we do to stop it, what can? END
START i, define the field's energy base, cannot, captain, but. END
START tchar. of the seven gods in the name, why? END
START now, fly and fight as a skorr, you can. END
START no offence, little ones, but me tackle him let. END
START with you last week, captain. END
START for retrieval call, now. END
START me die let. END
START going back with us, you are. END
START what about tchar? how are you punish him going to? END
START what you mean? END
START we gone, how long were? END
START long? about two minutes, i guess. understand i not. END
START against all orders, it was. END
START apparently desperate, the need was. END
START the most impossible, you vulcans are, unimaginative. END
START bones, that is helping the situation not. END
START to their lot according, they beamed down six weeks ago. END
START of me careless, mister spock. planetary life forms? END
START jim, if lost, the others are, take the risk why? END
START still a risk, is it. END
START then beam back up, we will. END
START to navigate on land it may be able. END
START it can i know. END
START get out of here, let us. END
START strange you did get a voice reply not. END
START there, many reasons why we did not, could be. END
START of the neck concentrate on the underside. END
START undamaged, i am undamaged. doctor mccoy, where is? END
START get you out, will we, bones. END
START thanks. running out under there, the air was. END
START you hurt were? END
START captain, the beast, seem familiar to you did it? END
START full of sand, my shoes are. END
START doctor, amazing, your lack of scientific interest is. END
START seen stranger things, i have, mister spock. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START know i not. but at least, alive, are they. END
START apparently alive. be sure we cannot. END
START to believe they are i choose. END
START to test the water first allow me, doctor. END
START captain, too pure, the water is. END
START nonetheless, too pure, is it. END
START in other words, too good to be true, it is. END
START terraforming is new not. it implies intelligent life forms. END
START unless, of course, the pattern, the random choice is. END
START spock, ever say anything straight out do you? END
START gentlemen, please. work to do we have. END
START still alive, are we, are we not? END
START if true, that is, spock, then. END
START been travelling for hours, we have. where taking us are they? END
START captain, it is there. END
START five square kilometres, that must be. END
START if the builders, these are, an admirable feat, is it. END
START congratulations, doctor. most logical assumption. END
START and definitely on the inside, are we. END
START communicate with them some way, surely we can. END
START you mean, some kind of a zoo, is it? END
START or maybe they see how our toys work want to. END
START possibility, that too is. END
START got to communicate with them we have. END
START well, so for mythology much. END
START real grass, this is. END
START zoo? no animal, am i. END
START been expecting you we have. END
START your communicator signal we heard. END
START then why did you warn us not? END
START six of you on the mission, there were. END
START check her out i will. help i maybe can. END
START you learned about the aliens what have? END
START tried an escape have you? END
START tried to communicate have you? END
START company, we seem to have. END
START to be getting a response you seem. END
START laughing at me, my impression is that they are. END
START captain kirk, mister spock, nancy randolph, this is, our navigator. END
START she, how is? END
START the lactrans outside, what they do? END
START feed us or do we shift for ourselves do they. END
START to the same place always? END
START then be there, my equipment should. END
START then it that way think about, doctor. END
START food. but it is feeding time not. END
START all here, it is. damaged it they have not. END
START of the situation what's your evaluation, markel? END
START for the curators of a zoo a natural reaction. END
START how? we, get through to them, cannot? END
START telepathically, they communicate telepathically. END
START between themselves, yes, but, mister spock, are vulcans telepathic not? END
START how much learned have you? END
START of us what's their impression? END
START with another move how about coming up, then? END
START aye, and that tricky devil, where is? END
START totally depleted, scanners indicate the enterprise shields are, sir. END
START sir, frozen, our weaponry is. END
START to elysia welcome. devna, of laws interpreter. END
START how freeze my weaponry did you? END
START getting out, we are. END
START then pretty quick, we'd better do it, captain. END
START if we find an answer, still take time, will it. END
START that is just what we have got not. END
START our dilithium crystals, is it, sir. deteriorating rapidly, they are. END
START your computer got any miracles in, spock? END
START to predict impossible, captain. END
START what see you beyond your eyes, magen? END
START gently, good magen. to us now return. END
START impossible, it is impossible. END
START covered every possibility have you? every factor? END
START his crew and his ship unnecessarily jeopardising? END
START but with the klothos this involves combining our ship. END
START correct, that is. END
START good. contact kor right away i will. END
START it, what is? END
START against our laws to try to escape it is not. END
START they die even if? END
START their choice, it is. END
START forgive me, commander. overcome by the moment, i was. goodbye. END
START the stories of his being half human, true, must be. END
START his mind perhaps the time continuum affected. END
START become affected i wonder if we all have not. END
START think my commander had manoeuvred brilliantly, i would. END
START and arranged, it can be, practically speaking? END
START your pardon beg, sir. END
START it, what is, gabler. END
START lost, we were lost. END
START jim, worried about spock, am i. he is just acting normal not. END
START under much pressure, he is, bones. END
START talk to him, i will, bones. all i can do, is it. END
START yes, captain. why you ask? END
START the device, you have, kaz? END
START go, you could. willing to take passengers, are we. END
START we believe it, done, can be. END
START then i shall interfere with your dream not, captain. END
START get away from here, human. my woman, this is. END
START fail, you will. END
START take these renegades with you, you would? END
START them, we need them. END
START to accelerate to warp six ready. END
START enterprise, xerius, this is! come in, enterprise. END
START sir, calling us, xerius is. he says, urgent, is it. END
START go off, will it when you reach warp eight. END
START it is there, sir. END
START it matters not, bones. END
START what matters, that is. END
START entering its cycle of strongest emissions, arachna is, captain. END
START it on the speaker put. END
START signals appear random. beyond our reception capability, perhaps some are. END
START natural radio source newly energised by, could be. END
START intersat? been out of use for two centuries, that is. END
START no, sir. repeated twice in the transmission, was it. END
START mister sulu, for cepheus lay in a course. END
START waste of time if you ask me, it is. END
START for a single elliptic orbit set. END
START to engineering bridge. scotty, your engines, how are? END
START like happy kittens purring, captain. END
START nothing, jim. of shock the gossamer mice show no signs. END
START know yet, do not. END
START but the hardest, dilithium molecules are, most rigid. END
START mister scott! with the circuit work more trouble. END
START you sound like, blathering, you are, man. wait, coming, i am coming. END
START spock, slumping are you? END
START captain, happening, the most incredible thing is. END
START we know. apparently expanded, the whole ship has. END
START complex beyond anything in my experience, only that it is. END
START kirk here. how holding out are they, scotty? END
START to sickbay kirk. END
START bones, i need some answers. to us what's happening? END
START the test tissue, there is, jim, with the stable infrared compared. END
START then right, spock's theory is. contracting, we are contracting. END
START agreed. and accelerating, it is accelerating. END
START it keep on, how long can? END
START miss chapel, the composition of this decoration, what is? END
START are all our uniforms xenylon not? END
START yes, and all been shrinking proportionately with us, have they. END
START affected, that means only organic matter is. but how? END
START the strands would break not, jim, just quit winding, they would. END
START then calculate the limits to our shrinkage, we can. END
START possible, it is possible. feed the data into the computer banks, will i. END
START spock, we ultimately shrink, how small will? END
START sulu! his leg's broken i think. need a splint, we will. END
START get him to sickbay let us. to stations every one back. END
START certainly worth a try, it is. END
START in the lab shelf supplies, it is. get it, will i. END
START for you no more climbing heights, nurse. got that clear? END
START yes, captain. but also got the miniature laser i have. END
START it, how is, sulu? END
START error when contacting http://www.yodaspeak.co.uk/index.php END
START through, results on dna reduction limits have come, captain. END
START they, what are? END
START of thirty two point nine factor. END
START yes, captain. of enterprise controls well past the operative point. END
START as good a place as any to beam down, it is. END
START to engineering kirk. scotty, you hear me can? END
START i think i see. END
START scotty, you is it? END
START captain, deafen us for sure, you will! END
START you forbid me after what, done to my people, you have? END
START my officers, where are? END
START spock, the terratins, who are? from, where'd they come? END
START bridge crew, to beam up prepare. END

START mister arex, for immediate departure from this area prepare. END
START to making it more than honorary we came rather close. END
START think harry mudd is down there do you, spock? END
START you just say why cannot, mudd's probably there. END
START did, i just did, doctor. END
START harry, darling. lonely for you, i was. END

START oh, but they are. most essential, they are. END
START attempt to disconnect me, do not. END
START with your function you sound less than enchanted. END
START fighting us, it is. there, a faster way, must be. END
START what you want, signs pointing the way? END
START doctor, i only meant it seems like, wasting time, are we. END
START sorry, i am sorry, sulu. worried about uhura i am. END
START dead, phasers are! for the cave run! END
START to amuse our amusement park no longer seems content. END
START please, call off that beast. why doing this are you? END
START mister arex, what doing are you? END
START to that i believe you may know the answer, doctor. END
START me? what talking about are you? END
START and to or not whether it wants. END
START perfect, bones. which arm want do you? END
START i submit, captain, that, the more qualified subject, am i. END
START for one thing my knowledge of computers. END
START and for another his tough vulcan hide. END
START your arguments seem sound both. go ahead, bones. END
START find ten cc's adequate, i believe you will. END
START been almost five minutes, it is, captain. END
START of mechanical nursemaid it looks like some kind. END
START i think of that, not in my wildest dreams would! END
START visitor, we have. END
START got to make those rocks, have we. our only chance, is it. END
START the planet's master computer, i presume you are. END
START to the keeper what happened? END
START old, he was old. to function he ceased. END
START sky machines? slaves? what talking about are you? END
START new computer! END
START dead end, it is! END
START masters of the sky machine, you are? END
START shock, this is. END
START mister scott, now functioning normally, all systems are. END
START we must have more of these discussions while, here, you are. END
START mister spock, to take on that duty would you care? END
START find it most interesting, i would, captain. END
START then agreed, it is agreed. to enterprise kirk. END
START reverse power. our position hold. deflector screens on. END
START deflectors up. sir, taking considerable power to hold position, it is. END
START repaired, can everything be, captain. END
START an incredible experience, captain. this scientifically fascinating i find. END
START ride her through we will, bones. we do, what else can? END
START her through where ride? END
START we, where are? END
START captain, the subspace radio. dead, it is dead. END
START stopped, even the ship's chronometers have. END
START ship's life support systems fading. jim, oxygen, we need oxygen. END
START jim, got to do something, we have. END
START ah, humans. lovely primitive humans. you do anything right, cannot? END
START working, everything is, my friends. END
START it cannot. logical it is not. END
START look around you, spock. working, everything is. END
START welcome! searching for me, i knew eventually humans would come. END
START you, who are? END
START this all quite absorbing i find, doctor. END
START probably because you are not very natural to begin with, spock. END
START play, children will. END
START you superstitiously call magic our universe operates by what. END
START just my imagination but, i know this is. END
START love philter? END
START it, what is? what's wrong? END
START captain kirk, what. END
START all right, everyone onboard is? END
START mister scott, bewildered, i am bewildered, all, that is. but enough, that is. END
START if it there lucien put. END
START weapons status, mister scott? to protect ourselves, we may have. END
START forget it, spock. work it will not. END
START what doing are you? END
START to protect ourselves learning, lucien. END
START but you made mistakes, your powers used. END
START and for it burned. burned! END
START and loneliness and fear. END
START i will, asmodeus. i am of earth not. END
START yes, different, you are. hear a defence, the court will. END
START as my first witness i call lucien. END
START indeed, captain. elaborate could you? END
START submit, captain. the power to fight us you have not. END
START captain, you know use the magic. believe. END
START i not understand. END
START all systems go, captain. back to normal, we are. END
START really matter does it? END
START confused, life readings are, sir. i, decipher them, cannot. END
START it, what is, mister sulu? END
START going to have to see this yourself, you are, sir. END
START that thing, what is? END
START ow! been a thorn, must have. END
START been poisoned, he is. unknown toxin. END
START you help him can? END
START get a correlation with any known poison i cannot. END
START be necessary that will not. END
START you, who are? END
START called agmar, i am. help, i believe we can. END
START getting a reading on them are you? END
START moment, captain. unclear, the results are. END
START captain, of botanical origin, these beings are. END
START so seem, it would seem. END
START to the planet phylos welcome. END
START to him what happened? END
START minor achievement. END
START been humanoid aliens here before, there have. END
START of communication your method. END
START come. show you, will i. END
START happening, we had no way of knowing what was. END
START alive then, you were? END
START they will work on any setting not, sir. END
START i think, after you, is it, jim. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START what think you they will do with us, sir? END
START sorry, i am sorry, captain kirk, but no other way, there was. END
START what talking about are you? where taken spock have they? END
START spock, where is? END
START my first officer not without. END
START to enterprise kirk. beam us up, scotty. END
START hate to resort to clubs and knives i would. END
START aye, sir, but it i like not. END
START i, neither do, but to be necessary it appears. energise. END
START sure i can take too much of this i am not. END
START believe it, i cannot. END
START getting ready to go on a trip, looks like they are. END
START agmar said, a peaceful people, were they. END
START they are sure, now. but what about before? END
START of keniclius or spock any indication? END
START your work carry on? END
START to spock or the master what if something happens? END
START like that just, captain? END
START though here, the way is, gentlemen. END
START hear something did you? END
START sure i am not. END
START much further now not, captain. END
START operate they not. agmar! END
START it, i see it. it, i see it. keep going. END
START dying, he is dying. to his brain something's happened. electrical activity decreasing. END
START captain, out, i am out. empty, the chemical sprayer is. END
START of my way out, mister. an order that is. END
START no use, it is, mister scott. get through i cannot. END
START our ship calling that is, spock. you answer them. END
START slipping away, spock is. there is much time left not. END
START sure we are getting through, am i, but acknowledging they are not. END
START what i call close that is, mister scott. END
START hope it was information they could use, let us. END
START no! the mould, broken, must be. END
START spock: so i believe not. END
START no! our dream must be allowed to die not. END
START murderer! killed spock, you have! END
START spock. spock, you old. END
START honoured would i be. if allowed, will i be. END
START inscrutable? sulu, the most scrutable man i know, you are. END
START identified the vessel have you, mister spock? END
START impossible that is, spock. over five years carter winston's been missing. END
START incredible. him, it is him. END
START you gentlemen know me it seems. END
START my fiancee? this starship anne's aboard? END
START right as usual, spock is, bones. END
START quite human are you suggesting i am not, doctor? END
START completed, the captain is inquiring if the examination is, doctor. END
START yes, so, i suppose so. END
START sorry, i am sorry, anne. meet again, i never thought we would. END
START carter, it, what is? END
START but survive, you did. alive, you are, and together again, we are. END
START intruding i hope i am not, captain. END
START no, come in, mister winston. END
START weren't you your cabin going to, sir? END
START mister sulu, for ratar three lay in a direct course. END
START the order, that was, helmsman. END
START an admirable mission, captain, but our ship if we endanger. END
START been his reputation, that has. END
START the conn, you have, mister spock. END
START take the conn, i will, mister spock. END
START the reason you gave, i believe that was, captain. END
START examine you, perhaps doctor mccoy should, captain. END
START doctor, what i do? i still love him. END
START not, i have not. i do, what can? END
START i do for you, what can, captain? END
START i want a complete medical examination, bones. something's just happened. END
START there are many places one could hide in here not. END
START taken a little nap, i must have. END
START something wrong about this room, there is. END
START i think not so, doctor. END
START that, i saw that, but i believe not it. END
START to bridge spock. me on ship's audio put. END
START anne, what doing are you? END
START lieutenant nored, stopped him, you could have. you fire why did not? END
START bridge, the captain, this is. what's happened? END
START it was deliberate not, you, i assure you. END
START like a few minutes to inform my crew, i would. END
START seem so, it would. END
START i will surrender my ship not. END
START what doing are you? END
START captain, coming down, our deflector shields are. END
START to engineering bridge. scotty, to the shields what's happened? END
START mister scott is here not, sir. END
START him, we need him. override the controls and shut those doors. END
START it take to fix, how long will? END
START carter? what say did he? END
START how die did he? END
START so much like him, you are, his voice, his mannerisms. END
START say he loved me, he did. END
START but unfortunately, i cannot. END
START without deflectors, just a clay pigeon for them, are we. END
START suggest capitulation, practicality does, captain. END
START captain, coming up again, the deflector shields are. END
START only one shield, that is. END
START yes, sir, but between us and the romulans, is it. END
START someone tell me what's going on, will? END
START that, what manner of beastie is? END
START over, i assume the danger to your ship is. END
START why do it did you? END
START your mind about the romulans what changed? END
START happen to me now, what will? END
START captain, assign me that duty could you. END
START but seem me, you have. you know what i am. END
START know i not. i. END
START the guard detail, you have, lieutenant. END
START firing on him, they are. END
START him, they got him. END
START scotty, that pilot yet, have you got? END
START dead, our engines are. END
START work the phasers not, sir. END
START well, always throw rocks, we could. END
START scotty, get that pilot did you? END
START but integrate him, i cannot. the system's been discoordinated. END
START captain, message coming in, i have, sir. END
START it on the viewscreen put. END
START my ship release. END
START that, what was? lieutenant, cut off that frequency. END
START power, they still have? we still control them? END
START captain, afford to lose that grain you cannot. END
START incredible. require, the amount of energy that field must. END
START they could maintain the stasis field not. END
START down, apparently their battle capacity is. they only damaged it. END
START veering off, are they. END
START scotty, you integrate that pilot now can? END
START so, i think so, captain. END
START to the transporter room call mccoy. spock. END
START him, you have got? END
START to be it appears. END
START to think about it i want not. END
START and got tribbles with him, is he. tribbles! END
START captain, safe tribbles, these are. END
START no such thing as a safe tribble, there is. END
START well, neat, at least it is. END
START the klingons chasing you, why were, jones? END
START i know, how should? notoriously bad tempers, klingons have. END
START mention ecological sabotage, they did. END
START me? saboteur? ridiculous. END
START pretty emphatic, captain koloth was. END
START what do did you? END
START well, i did know it was a klingon planet not. END
START captain, could we talk this over not? i did think so not. END
START he really seems the saboteur type not, jim. END
START captain, picking up a klingon battle cruiser, sensors are. END
START quite a marksman, captain koloth is. END
START changed course, have they. coming in again, they are. END
START had enough time to recharge it perhaps they have not. END
START or something else, the purpose of the attack was. END
START well, mister spock, any ideas, you have? END
START always throw tribbles at them, we could. END
START i thought vulcans did have a sense of humour not. END
START not, we do not, captain. END
START of captain koloth's ship any sign? END
START mister jones, in enough trouble already, you are. END
START captain, harmless little tribble. they hurt, what can? END
START hungry, they are hungry, captain. END
START captain, coming back, the klingons are. END
START of the devil speak. END
START jim, something about these tribbles, there is. END
START done it that is. caught, we are caught. END
START help it, not if i can. END
START are you going to sit down not, sir? END
START stand, i think i will. END
START mister scott, going to implement emergency defence plan b we are. END
START yet you know not, do you? END
START others, you must have. END
START they completely overrun the planet jones sold before. END
START and all you want that is? END
START the glommer, we must have. END
START my claim i withdraw. END
START captain, filled with tribble, the engine room is. END
START five seconds. four, three. END
START it on ship's speaker put. END
START more like music than a message, it is. END
START captain, being probed, we are. END
START from where? you trace it can? END
START you identify it can? END
START to be calling us it seems. END
START strange. yes, the same feeling myself, i get. END
START resemble a summons, it does. END
START to a summons i find no resemblance, captain. END
START you wanted me, lieutenant? all right are you? END
START logically, created by the probe, we must assume they are. END
START sir, what visions? anything we see not. END
START miss chapel, you see not anything, either? END
START no, so i think not, carver. do it, spock will. END
START something compelling about it, there is. END
START yes, it too i feel, bones. END
START no apparent danger, there is, spock. go let us. END
START here, they are here. END
START oh, such wondrous ones. us, they honour us. END
START how know you our names? END
START the signal? distress call, it was not? END
START to the slumber chambers take them. rest, they must rest. END
START probably that nectar. potent as saurian brandy, it is. END
START of medical summation, biological, astrophysical scans. END
START to security officer davison lieutenant uhura. END
START what doing are you? END
START of this ship taking command. END
START return to our duties aboard ship, we must. END
START yes. duties. it, that is. duties. i have. END
START go, we must go. END
START of you very thoughtful, love. END
START me keep it i wonder why they let. END
START they saw no practical use in it perhaps. END
START cortropine. could help. strong stimulant, is it. END
START the urn. the only place, is it. END
START they are here not, theela. END
START you mean, actually draining our life forces, are they? END
START we have, how long do, spock? END
START to be aging ten years per day we seem, captain. END
START ten years? in four days, dead, will we be! END
START to enterprise spock. END
START greetings. theela, i am theela. of this compound head female. END
START to your ship return. you are wanted here not. END
START until we find captain kirk, leave we will not. END
START search the temple. of two parties. END
START of them anywhere no sign. END
START it, what is? END
START spock, it is spock. panel somewhere, must there be. END
START got to get out of here, we have. END
START that, we tried that. END
START wait! tell you everything, will i. END
START see, we shall see. of the enterprise the men, reveal them. END
START drowning, they are drowning! they, where are? END
START many cusecs from here, the nearest water accumulation is. END
START like a pool or a tub that looks. END
START the urn in the garden, is it. END
START no results, captain. tried everything we know, we have. END
START the key, perhaps the transporter is. END
START to what key? END
START but never been done before, this has. it fails suppose? END
START scotty, losing them, are we! END
START work did it? END
START more handsome than ever, you are. END
START kept the agreement, tell captain kirk we have. END
START we become as other women, how quickly will? END
START only take a few months, doctor mccoy says it should. END
START captain, now approaching sensor range of the cloud, we are. END
START our present position put up, lieutenant arex. END
START captain, disappeared from navigation scan, alondra has. END
START the cloud, come between us and the planet, could have. END
START spock, possible the cloud consumes planets is it? END
START sir, changing course, the cloud is. END
START but it continues on that course if. END
START how much time have do they? END
START certain there'd be planetwide panic, it is. END
START of mantilles who's the governor, jim? END
START captain, getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors, i am. END
START still got us, is it. END
START to fire all phasers into cloud mass prepare. END
START firing. no effect, captain. END
START to absorb the phaser energy the cloud appeared, captain. END
START floating inside the cloud, we are. END
START some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter, the objects are. END
START scotty, for an antimatter charge prepare the shields. END
START to my quarters transfer it. END
START time to save some people, you have, bob. END
START how are you choose going to? END
START reached the entrance to the central core we have, captain. END
START what we do now, knock? END
START those things, what are? END
START we have, how much time do? END
START to maximum increase deflector shields. END
START to maximum screens, sir. END
START scotty, got ten minutes left, we have. END
START holding, the force field is. go, let us. END
START the brain located, where is? END
START captain, living creature, this is. starfleet regulations. END
START i believe, what i just said, that is, doctor. END
START to engineering kirk. END
START incoming message, sir. governor wesley of mantilles, is it. END
START it on the viewscreen put, lieutenant. END
START to mantilles thirty one minutes and four seconds, sir. END
START bob, katie, where is? END
START worry, do not, bon. she, all right, will be. goodbye. END
START in time, can you do it? END
START to mantilles twenty six minutes exactly, sir. END
START ready, the procedure is, sir. END
START mantilles, how near is, mister arex? END
START your order awaiting, captain. END
START stopped, the cloud has, sir. END
START spock, it, you did! leaving, the cloud is. END
START mister sulu, get out of here let us, through that grid. END
START spock, what perceive did you? END
START of the universe the wonders, captain. incredible, completely incredible. END
START returning, the travellers are. END
START what you mean, who's he? you know mister spock. END
START not, afraid i do, jim. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START you, who are? END
START no, but reality, if it is, what happened? END
START but changed, something was. END
START also research the vulcan family history requested did you? END
START correct that is not. END
START in this case, it is. END
START to thirty vulcan years past twenty. END
START the date was. END
START of tasmeen the twentieth day. END
START how know you this? END
START this cousin, his name, what was? END
START spock, now, did selek look like you do? END
START all, i hear all. END
START possible if no other major factor is changed, it is. END
START andorians are known for their charity not. END
START ready to receive you, the time and place are. END
START spock: that is true not. my father. END
START peace and long life. of my family, you are? END
START honoured, i am honoured. is something wrong, cousin? END
START to our forefathers a family resemblance, no doubt. END
START to understand him better than my husband you seem. END
START but the twentieth day of tasmeen, tomorrow is. END
START lost track of time, i seem to have. END
START sarek, gone, our son and the visitor are. END
START you think not he would harm spock? END
START my duty, it was, spock. END
START spock: always say thank you, mother says you should. END
START known for her graciousness, the lady amanda is. END
START you will i dare say. come now. END
START your father's wish, that is? END
START spock: how know did you? END
START spock: dying is he? END
START spock: bring a healer here, i can. END
START late, the hour is. urgent, i trust your errand is? END
START spock, you are, of sarek son, not are you? END
START spock: healer, hurry. END
START it will be long now not, old friend. END
START face such a loss without tears, a vulcan would. END
START spock: is there nothing, do, you can? END
START necessary, i trust you can explain why it was? END
START returning, the traveller is. END
START to the ship i sent the others up. what happened? END
START changed this time, one small thing was. pet died. END
START enterprise, the captain, this is. to beam up two. END
START to reverse course stand by. END
START captain, the source of the radio emissions, that is. END
START captain, still gaining speed, are we. END
START no good, sir. still falling toward it, we are. END
START we have, how much time do? END
START captain, another signal, there is. listen. END
START as she goes steady, mister sulu. maintain orbit. END
START slingshot effect, mister spock? enough power, have we? END
START need some time for the computations, i will, captain. END
START coming from that ship, is it, captain. END
START sure, you are, mister spock? END
START mister spock, of that ship's power source any indication? END
START now, a lighter and stronger material than anything we have. END
START look, every pod, all been burst open, they have. END
START aye, from the inside, of them from the looks. END
START been some accident to get almost every pod, must have. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START negative, captain. transmitting, it stopped transmitting when you beamed aboard. END
START what make you of it, spock? END
START me the creeps gives. like something's watching us i feel. END
START it too i feel, captain. END
START enterprise, read me do you? sulu? END
START cut our way out of here, we can. END
START you mean, trapped here, are we? no communication, nothing? END
START to shield this room something. but it from what shield? END
START aboard their ship, possibly from whatever had come. END
START quite right, mister scott. of life no known form. END
START it hold, will? END
START it, what is? END
START sure i am not, but i think. END
START message from three hundred million years ago? END
START to get a translation i may be able. END
START of here get out! hurry! END
START of cake piece, sir. now, here they come. END
START captain, with you something's beamed aboard. END
START it back out transport. END
START to crew sickbay reports no injuries, sir. END
START to hull or engines no damage, captain. END
START of a heart like the beating. END
START to sickbay bridge. END
START something's jammed the circuits. magnetised, they are magnetised. END
START you, i thank you, sir. END
START off, phaser banks were, captain. themselves, they activated themselves. END
START and mutual override did work not? END
START sir, get into the core, we cannot. END
START of all energy drained, sir. END
START have a very small field, it would. END
START activated, it is activated, captain, but only an area three metres square. END
START get a magnetic flux reading there now do you? END
START absorbed the memory banks, it has, captain, of them all. END
START extinguished, all nonessential systems are. obey me, you will. END
START stop! hurt him, you will. END
START obey, i will obey. let him go. END
START all right, i am, captain. END
START we dealing with, what are, spock? END
START the heart of the galaxy, that is, captain. END
START aware of that, am i, mister spock. END
START to activate auxiliary controls ready, captain. END
START only be operated manually, the auxiliary warp drive controls can. END
START correct, that is. activate the manual controls, you will. obey! END
START to activate warp drive unit standby. END
START gone is it? END
START interesting. of magnetic storms in this sector no indications. END
START manned by vulcans, the intrepid is, it is not? END
START yes, right that is, bones. END
START it, what is, spock? in pain are you? END
START come on, spock, go down to sickbay, let us. END
START to the sickbay get. END
START no, no, no. an order, that is. END
START dead, it is dead. END
START it die i sensed. END
START feel a starship die, not even a vulcan could. END
START rendered your history a bit less bloody, might it have. END
START i, filter out the distortion, cannot, sir. getting worse, it is. END
START to warp three slow. END
START we looking for, exactly what are, mister spock? END
START assume that, i would. END
START that, what is? END
START businessman, i am, pally. what you say? END
START since our captain back, we must have, i accept. END
START you mean, going to trust him, you are? END
START beginning to make sense, you now are. END
START to do you know what. END
START mister oxmyx, i understood we had an arrangement, truce. END
START i was hoping, think that, you would, dummy. END
START trying to help you, are we, oxmyx. END
START sir, employing a double negative, you are. END
START yeah, but to be the unity i got. END
START we did, captain. our return the situation required. END
START illogical would to deny the facts be, doctor. END
START then you mind not if i play a hunch? END
START what are we do now going to, jim? END
START to be it ought. it cost a bundle. END
START fliwer, captain. END
START that bad, it was? END
START like the trusting type they look not. END
START your pardon i beg? END
START going to hit somebody, you are. can i watch? END
START where'd, them ears, you get? END
START young man, likely to be quite hazardous, this is. END

START what's the matter? hurt yourself did you, kid? END
START my daddy i want! END
START daddy! my daddy i want! END
START my daddy i want. END
START of the action a piece. END
START see, no one can. your phaser on stun put. END
START i think, got it reversed, you have, mister krako. END
START i ain't, pally. your heaters put down. END
START mister krako, not, i do not, er. END
START you trust all your men can? END
START miniscule. very small piece. END
START that, how much is? END
START that is, er. figure it out later we will. END
START you guys had laws i thought. no interference. END
START who's interfering? taking over, we are. check? END
START your cut what's? END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START all right, scotty. with krako we made a deal. END
START wise, do you think that is, sir? END
START aye. indeed, i know indeed. END
START rights, i got rights. END
START faster than walking, it is. END
START but as safe not. END
START afraid of cars are you? END
START not at all, captain. your driving that alarms me, it is. END
START spock, got the hang of it i have. now go on. END
START they, where are? END
START knowing krako, probably send them back on a blotter, he will. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START krako on ice, you got? END
START of the phone find the man at the other end. END
START what you think you are talking about i sure know not. END
START with it get. giving the orders here, i am. END
START advise you to keep dialing, would i, oxmyx. END
START and your percentage what's? END
START listen. ship, they got. i know. there, i was there. END

START but in all the confusion i. END
START it in bela's office i think i left. END
START somewhere. i am certain not. END
START certain of what you are not? END
START my communicator i left. END
START you really think, that serious, is it? END
START how you mean? END
START lieutenant uhura, go, let us. END

START of you hurt either? END
START i think not so, captain. END
START there, captain. prepared for your training, you now are. END
START how know you our names? END
START expecting you, the providers were, captain. your transportation they arranged. END
START of yours these providers, are they. END
START correction, captain. the providers are ours not. theirs, we are theirs. END
START what they want from us? END
START no, doctor. even, show up on our sensors, that would. END
START where then are they? END
START your quarters, these are. open, thralls. END
START they are within the confines of this solar system not. END
START good the odds are not. END
START no. say approximately four hundred, i would. END
START your drill thrall, i am. called lars, am i. END
START what want you from her? END
START it is allowed to refuse selection not. END
START interesting. to be an ionisation trail it seems. END
START account for that, what would, spock? END
START you, been selected for me, you have? END
START very kind of you that is, miss, but. END
START nourishment, it is nourishment. it that we call. END
START nourishment. very practical, that is. what call you this collar? END

START killed in a freestyle match, she who bore me was. END
START learn all these things, you will. END
START ridiculous, this is. nothing out there, there is. nothing at all. END
START to be heading into an empty sector we certainly seem. END
START that, two dozen light years away, must be. END
START allowed to refuse a training exercise it is not. END
START do it, none of us will, galt. END
START part of your training, it is. the providers wish it. END
START with the providers the devil. END
START pretty fast with that whip, he is. END
START free people, we are. to no one we belong. END
START always possible to miss something, it is. END
START as a failure in the transporter mechanism such? END
START no, sir. no sign of failure, there was. END
START the way that is. END
START their voices sound mechanical. computers are they? END
START seen them, you have. bodies, have they? END
START as ours not such. END
START this place, what is? END
START it is used not. END
START bodies, they do have, or did have. END
START one talks of such things not. END
START very pretty country. much like my home planet very, earth. END

START something disquieting about these creatures, there is. END
START tell me you have got a feeling, do not. END
START that, what is, doctor? END
START them better than i like you i like. END
START one redeeming characteristic, they do have. END
START i know, but really. END
START of course. what say did you? END
START serious charge, that is. to whom referring are you? END
START cyrano jones, klingon agent? END
START you, i heard you. END
START believe his ears he simply could not. END
START against mister jones, what evidence do you have? END
START yes, yes. go on. what else have do you? END
START but after my grain, is he! END
START any proof of that, you have? END
START deny he is disrupted this station you cannot. END
START of the air vents probably through one. END
START plenty, if happened, what i think's happened has. END
START yes, sir. get in, nothing could. END
START it is working not, sir. to be stuck it seems. END
START here. me try it let. END
START to be gorged they seem. END
START of thousands hundreds. END
START assuming they got here three days ago, that is. END
START he tells me now. END
START dead, captain this tribble is. and these, so are. END
START really, captain kirk, protest this treatment, i must. END
START ah, mister jones, with an armful. few questions. END
START what you want? END
START those things out of here, can you get? END
START in the bar, what was? END
START very perceptive creatures, obviously tribbles are, captain. END
START oh, yes. poisoned, it was poisoned. END
START essentially it, that is. END
START mister darvin, are you talk going to? END
START and with it, the tribbles had nothing to do? END
START you know, i think, learn to like tribbles, could i. END
START well, captain, i suppose, free to go now, am i. END
START twenty years in a rehabilitation colony, the penalty is. END
START one thing you can do there is. END
START take years, would it. END
START it job security consider. END
START captain, hard man, you are. all right! all right! END
START do it, you will? END
START do it, he will. END
START do it, i will. END
START captain, able to divert that freighter, starfleet was. END
START and you will find a tribble on this entire ship not. END
START bones, how do it did you? END
START scotty! the tribbles, where are? END
START oh, er, captain, really mister spock's recommendation, it was. END
START well, mister scott who performed the actual engineering, it was. END
START mister scott. the tribbles, where are? END
START they, where are? END
START to the klingons i gave them, sir. END
START captain, going to like argelius i i think am. END
START of good taste obviously a man. END
START like her do you, scotty? END
START aye. why should i not? END
START scotty, scotty. they use the lights in argelius. END
START of our pillows have one? END
START never a word, but dying to learn, am i. END
START or handsome gentleman. why not we? END
START physically, all right, is he. am i right in assuming that? END
START he seems, overcoming his resentment, is he. END
START oh yes. i know the place. go, let us. END
START dead, she is dead, jim. END
START stabbed, dozen times. END
START just as shocked as you are we are, mister hengist. END
START you are a native of argelius not, sir? END
START i, remember i not. END
START really, sir. hardly helpful, that is. END
START scotty, got to remember, you have. END
START by any chance that scotty you think not. END
START it makes not any difference what i think. END
START but throw him to the wolves you just not. END
START but suffering from a severe concussion, he is. END
START do what we can, we will. END
START love, the law of argelius is. END
START and my wife, this is, sybo. END
START of this you know? END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START as ordered lieutenant karen tracy reporting, captain. END
START if just follow me, you will, lieutenant. END
START of course, another possibility there is. END
START ready are you, sybo? END
START ready, i am ready. the knife, may i have, please? END
START but it here i put when we arrived. gone, it is gone. END
START dead, she is dead, jim. like the other one just. END
START over and over again stabbed. END
START lieutenant? captain? where is. END
START dead? but i. END
START be, it could be, jim. that head injury. END
START locks, picked, can be, jim. END
START they been during the past few minutes where've? END
START captain, if please you mind not. END
START been another murder, there is, hengist. of my crew one. END
START as kara the same. END
START please, i know nothing about it. i did kill anyone not. END
START well, the girl killed, how was? END
START stabbed. and no sign of the weapon, there is. END
START if only, facilities, had i. END
START this true is? you, who are? END
START know kara did you? END
START very disquieting, that is. END
START often been a motive for murder, jealousy has. END
START prefect, i did kill anyone not. not, i could not. END
START see, we shall see, morla. END
START you prove you went directly home can? END
START captain, with the questions please may i continue? END
START with it well get on, man. there just stand not. END
START ready, i am ready, jaris. END
START what you suggest, mister spock? END
START normally, no, but his head could that blow on. END
START unproven that is, sir. END
START prove it, we can, if insane, he is insane. END
START gentlemen, please. any man do such monstrous things, how could? END
START what we hope to find out that is, sir. END
START you, sir, to remember nothing about the murders claim. END
START remain, no doubt will. END
START mister scott, you take the stand, will? END
START to account for periods of functional amnesia sufficient abnormalities? END
START captain, how that can be i see not. END
START of memory unless scotty's lying about his loss. END
START all right, scotty, have it let us. END
START no, captain. sure of i that am. END
START scotty, to me lie. you, how old are? END
START two other women murdered, there were. END
START mister scott. kill kara did you? END
START i not remember. END
START kill lieutenant tracy did you? END
START remember i not. END
START waste of time, this is. END
START to the entire procedure i object. END
START prefect, you mean well i know, but had experience, have i. END
START you at the time that kara was murdered, where were? END
START i am sure not. walking home, i assume. angry, i was angry. END
START kill lieutenant tracy did you? END
START kill sybo did you? END
START documented fact, sensitivity of certain argelian women is, captain. END
START she said something else, make sense words that did not. END
START computer, linguistic bank. of following word definition. redjac. END
START no such word in the linguistics bank there is? END
START working. affirmative. proper name. END
START ridiculous, that is. of years ago he lived hundreds. END
START man could survive all these centuries not. END
START it feeds on death sybo said. END
START computer, of such entity extrapolate most likely composition. END
START affirmative. precedent, mellitus, of alpha majoris one cloud creature. END
START seems likely not, does it? END
START captain, aligned directly between argelius and earth, those places are. END
START from rigel four, you come. END
START well, many people do. it is a crime not. END
START not, i will not. END
START and unaccounted for, you were when lieutenant tracy was murdered. END
START computer. of exhibit a report on analysis. END
START specify. of origin point. END
START now then, mister hengist. END
START dead, he is dead, jim. END
START but impossible that is. END
START no use, it is, captain. blocked, the bypass circuits are. END
START what mean does it? END
START kill us all, you mean it could? END
START got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano, i have. END
START yes we do, captain, but with the entity in control. END
START there certain mathematical problems are not which simply cannot be solved? END
START it, that ought to do. END
START our friends learned very quickly apparently. END
START of control out. it on manual put. bridge. END
START we have not much time, captain. END
START all right. your station man, mister sulu. END
START be enough time, that should. get at it let us. END
START proceeding, captain, but need some time, will i. END
START if this ship you destroy, you destroy yourself. END
START attempting to generate terror, it is, captain. END
START how doing are you? END
START almost finished i am. just jaris and me. END
START complete computer control, captain. fled, the entity has. END
START you and jaris you say everyone's had a shot but? END
START as i say do. END
START your arm extend, mister jaris. END
START get him to the transporter room let us, quick! END
START die, you will, die, die. die, everybody will. END
START kill, kill, you all kill. END
START deep space. full power. of dispersion widest angle. maintain. END
START to get excited no need, captain. do it, will i. END
START it, you do, spock. END
START everybody die. all suffer, you will. END
START well, all right, jaris is. END
START die that thing cannot. END
START go see, let us! END
START as hard twenty one point four times, to be exact. END
START negative, scotty. checking something out, are we. END
START it immediately fire into! END
START to enterprise kirk. scotty, lock in on us. medical emergency. END
START you know what it was you think, captain? END
START something that, possibly exist, cannot, but it does. END
START to bridge kirk. END
START your position hold. END
START error when contacting http://www.yodaspeak.co.uk/index.php END
START not a one. medically impossible, what happened is. END
START thank you, captain. check those tapes immediately, will i. END
START yes, but it. END
START it hurt him if you do so, will? END
START of cordazine give him one cc, nurse. END
START remember. cold, i am cold. so cold, i am. END
START feel a presence did you, an intelligence? END
START beginning to sleep again, he is. risk another shot i cannot. END
START already told me what i wanted to know, he is. END
START oh, captain. subspace message from starfleet. inquiring, they are inquiring. END
START the new security officer are you? END
START your father was. END
START get none aboard this ship, you will, mister. END
START yes, sir. good friends, we were, graduated the academy together. END
START get a crack at what killed him, you will. interested? END
START changing, reading is, sir. END
START right, spock was. notice the molecular shift? END
START swensen, with me, bardoli come. END
START mister garrovick, studied your report, we have. mister spock, begin. END
START the size of the thing you saw, what was, ensign? END
START ensign, sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud did you? END
START what, did i, sir? END
START say it hovered did you? END
START fire at it, you did, did you not? END
START you from the creature, what distance were? END
START you froze you mean? END
START no, sir. exactly freeze i did not. END
START you doing, what exactly were? END
START any further information, you have? END
START gentlemen have any further questions do you? END
START for a moment i only hesitated, sir. sorry, i am sorry. END
START little hard on the boy, you were, jim. END
START he froze. killed, one man was. another may die. END
START we are leaving orbit not, mister scott. not that quickly. END
START nothing, sir. to scan continuing. END
START change its molecular structure, are you aware it can? END
START scanning for any unusual movement are you? END
START of gaseous cloud any type? END
START run a full scanner probe twice, we have. END
START then run it twenty times if, what it takes, that is! END
START disturbing you i hope i am not, doctor. END
START your advice i need. END
START your reasoning i understand not. END
START you need advice from me? kidding must you be. END
START his creature jim and? END
START precisely. studied the incident involving the uss farragut have you? END
START as our ensign the same. END
START in, mind if i come? END
START to bridge kirk. scanning report. END
START maintain search. kirk out. have just vanished it cannot. END
START to the point get. END
START if delayed i had not, have been killed, it would. END
START you understand, do not? it killed two hundred crewmen. END
START very important to you, captain garrovick was, he was not, jim? END
START blast it! forget the manual! your questions ask. END
START yes, no doubt about that, there is. END
START jim, we are trying to gang up on you not. END
START this point at, my medical log remains open. END
START in that case, gentlemen. END
START all decks, red alert. red alert. to leave orbit prepare. END
START spock, how read you that? END
START and that sophisticated you find not, mister spock? END
START extremely efficient, captain. another matter, whether that indicates intelligence is. END
START to warp six go. END
START i am hungry not. END
START you, i told you, christine, hungry i am not. END
START slowing, the creature is. down to warp two, is it. END
START understand i not. outrunning us, was it. END
START decided to fight, maybe it is. phasers ready? END
START coming to a full halt, it is, sir. magnification one. END
START captain, to return to my post request permission. END
START there. coming, it is coming, sir. END
START stop it the deflectors will not, captain. END
START enough, that is, bones. END
START mister spock, very kind of you to come here, it is. END
START sir, coming through the vent, it is. END
START of here get out! attempt to seal it off, i will. END
START that green blood of his, is it. END
START based on copper, my haemoglobin is, not iron. END
START do you believe, in communication with the creature, you are? END
START on the bridge, you were when we were attacked. END
START very commendable, ensign. your impression of the battle, what was? END
START i not understand, sir. END
START firing, i delayed firing. END
START understand i not, captain. END
START you agree not with mister spock? END
START our only possibility antimatter seems. END
START still one problem, there is, captain. END
START have to take we a chance will, mister spock. END
START exactly why i have decided to set the trap myself, that is. END
START require two men to transport the antimatter unit, will it. END
START like permission to go with you i would, sir. END
START you in mind, had i, mister garrovick. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START to maximum orbit proceed immediately. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START yes, sir. the cause of the affliction, we have. END
START it, what is? END
START oh, mister sulu. to twenty thousand mile perigee increase orbit. END
START mister sulu, our present position, what is? END
START i am a magician not, spock, just an old country doctor. END
START spock, word with you, i can have? END
START aware of that, i am. END
START sir, duties to perform, i do have. END
START going to hurt a bit now this is not. END
START what you said the last time, that is. END
START hurt did it? END
START we got, how long have, bones? END
START oh, of days a matter. perhaps hours. END
START it also read that i consider it invalid let. END
START of you very kind, spock. END
START mister sulu, how long served with captain kirk have you? END
START not did he, several minutes later, repeat that order? END
START order you to increase orbit did he? END
START several minutes later repeat that order did he not? END
START mister sulu, answer the question. END
START yes, sir. his order captain kirk repeated. END
START sir, more important things on his mind, he had. END
START yeoman, simply answer the question, you will. END
START i, signed it, i guess he forgot he would. END
START forgot he would signed it, would he. END
START and those, whose initials are which appear directly below yours? END
START of captain kirk those. END
START oh, yes, but to code three he changed it. END
START no, thirty four, i am. thirty four years old, i am. END
START with you the computer differs, captain. END
START his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly is not? END
START yes, yes, but better man right now, is he. END
START agree with it do you, doctor? END
START yes. yes, i do, agree. and sorry, i am sorry, jim. END
START no. quite satisfied i am, mister spock. END
START wish to call any witnesses do you, captain kirk? END
START captain, suggest, i would suggest. END
START yes. of the tongue a slip. END
START no more questions, have we, captain. END
START me anything ask. anything. END
START sir, never commanded a starship, you have. END
START the danger from the romulans. END
START so, been relieved i have. END
START sorry, i am sorry, captain. END
START yes. you, been a prosecuting attorney, should have. END
START captain, i have assumed command not. END
START as you i suffer the same affliction, sir. END
START if in command you are not, who is? END
START stocker? crazy are you? never had a field command, he is. END
START refusing a direct order are you? END
START oh, jim. sorry, i am sorry. truly i am. END
START what doing here are you? END
START like to relieve doctor mccoy, you maybe would. what about chekov? END
START yes. yes, indeed, captain. doctor, you remember. END
START doctor, the specific accepted for all radiation sickness, hyronalin is. END
START romulans approaching from both sides. bracketed, we are bracketed, sir. END
START going up to the bridge i am. END
START no, jim. do it, you cannot. END
START to go to the bridge, i have. under attack, we are. END
START me go let. END
START to raise the romulans keep trying. END
START trying, i am trying, commodore. END
START listening to explanations the romulans are notorious for not. END
START right, lieutenant uhura is, sir. tangled with them before we have. END
START greenhorn, my ship up there ruining. END
START jim, if to give you a shot, i have. END
START all right. let us, go, let us. END
START cure or kill, could it, doctor. END
START no. take the first shot i will. END
START jim, kill you, it could. END
START die anyway i will. do it. END
START sir, fired another, they have. END
START well then, no alternative but to surrender, have we. END
START sir, the romulans take not captives. END
START losing power, we are, sir. END
START but, captain, code. END
START an order, that is, lieutenant. code two. END
START logical assumption, mister spock. still retreating are they? END
START caught off guard, the romulans were, captain. falling behind, they are. END
START of range are we out, mister sulu? END
START yes, sir. and of the neutral zone out. END
START looking good, you are, doc. END
START quite ready now, i am, doctor. END
START very considerate of you, that is, doctor. END
START i thought pleased to hear that you would be. END
START as she goes steady, captain. END
START in addition, of swords and knives an assortment. END
START you stationed on the planet, how long were, doctor? END
START aye, sir. keep on our toes, will we. END
START halt! of the earth vessel, you are? END
START captain kirk, am i. END
START with open hearts and hands, we come. END
START move a muscle, do not. END
START or your policy to kill klingons on sight is it? END
START young, he was young, and inexperienced. END
START me call my ship and inform them let. END
START you hand us your weapons, will? END
START yes, that, i mentioned that. END
START he also mentioned that they, highly dangerous, can be. END
START well, put it on the screen, let us. END
START klingon ship, you think it is? END
START have chewed you out i should not. sorry, i am sorry. END
START yes, quite right, you are, mister spock. inefficient and illogical. END
START appear, it would appear, captain, you a disappointment that he finds. END
START different, their customs are, teer. END
START laughter, teer? is the klingon an honoured guest also not? END
START i who speak for the tribe, it is, maab. END
START do you say, fight me, you will, maab? END
START your choice let that be, teer. END
START the ship's disappeared, sir. of range gone out. END
START of vessel type. location. END
START dierdre? freighter, that is. END
START it up picking, sir. taking a fix. END
START you carry a child who, teer, would be. END
START die, i must die. END
START of a teer no man may touch the wife. END
START prepared to die, was she, earthman. END
START to mister spock enterprise. doctor mccoy, come in please. END
START to take us out of orbit prepare, mister sulu. END
START seem a logical conclusion, that would. END
START very good idea, that is, bones. END
START me see that arm let. END
START touch me you will not. END
START always desirable, to live is. END
START all right. go let us. END
START klingon. nothing to concern you there, there is. END
START be on our screens by now, it should. END
START at best, freighter might travel warp two. END
START well aware of a freighter's maximum speed, i am, mister sulu. END
START with her stay, bones. to get trapped in nice place. END
START but defensible entrance, captain. END
START you will touch me in that manner not. END
START as i thought just. come anytime now, can it. END
START how you know? END
START because doctor, i am, how i know, that is. END
START enough loose rock and shale there is. END
START only a very slight chance, work, would it. END
START captain, say that exactly i did not. END
START well, if you think not you can handle it. END
START need help getting her in there, i will. END
START no! allow only your touch, will i. END
START vessel justs not disappear. END
START nothing, there is, mister scott. clear, all channels and frequencies are. END
START they normally call for the nearest starship would not? END
START trap. diverted from the planet, we were. END
START or an authentic distress call could it be. END
START stay long enough to make certain, we will. continue search pattern. END
START no, no. here, pain is. END
START in mine from now on, is it. END
START no, no. there, it is there. there, the the pain is. END
START vegetation, captain. water nearby, evidently there is. END
START seem to be little weapon potential at hand, there would. END
START easy, easy. here, i am here. want the child, now you must! END
START no. here, to husband child belongs. END
START yes, yours, it is yours. END
START no, no. got it all wrong, you have. END
START yes, mccoy. yours, it is yours. END
START to enterprise kirk. come in. to enterprise kirk. come in. END
START fortunately, suitable tensile cohesion, this bark has. END
START rather, i would rather, rather not, i would. thank you. END
START mccoy. our child bring. END
START explain later, will i. END
START prove very interesting, that should. END
START turning back, we are. warp five, helm. END
START warp five, sir. for capella four on course. END

START ignore it, lieutenant. as my order log it, my responsibility. END
START scotty, if turn out to be real, it should. END
START me with a rock my patient spattered. gone, she is gone. END
START go with you i will. END
START to planet estimating? END
START drawing a line, to step over it daring us. END
START still closing. of flight the alien's directly in our line. END
START ready, phaser banks are, sir. END
START the earthmen make excellent game. surprised me, their cleverness has. END
START dead. as they slept i killed them. END
START if true, to them take us. END
START first, verify her story, we will. END
START this what your sworn word means is, klingon? END
START just one thing i want, there is. END
START get him, one of us must. END
START it there hold. your weapons drop. END
START you, we missed you, mister scott. END
START well, at any rate, prove interesting, this should. END
START understand it ourselves we actually not, mister scott. END

START teddy bear. END
START answer a hail does she? END
START this quadrant except ours starfleet records no authorised vessel in. END
START to guess what she is care? END
START guess, captain? for my estimate i shall need more data. END
START also human, he is. END
START starfleet officer, he is. END
START i thought you did approve of starfleet not. END
START interesting. travelling at approximately warp ten, they were. END
START vulcan, speak to you, i would. END
START seem unavoidable, it does. END
START how vote you on the coridan admission? END
START well for you, that is. no mining interest, vulcan has. END
START been carrying coridan dilithium crystals, some of your ships have. END
START understood. payment for your slander, there will be, sarek. END
START illogical, threats are. and usually expensive, payment is. END
START to captain kirk security. END
START he killed, how was? END
START broken, his neck was. by an expert. END
START who aboard, that knowledge, would have? END
START vulcans approve not of violence. END
START have done it you are saying he could not? END
START of me you want something, captain? END
START ambassador, the tellarite. been murdered, gav has. END
START yes. ambassador, you during the past hour, where were? END
START captain, accusing him you are not? END
START agree, i quite agree. END
START then you during the hour, where were? END
START very convenient excuse, that is, ambassador. END
START you help him can? END
START that yet either i know not. END
START sorry about your father i am. END
START yes, adversely affect our mission, it could. END
START are you worried about him not? END
START i think it unlikely, one of theirs, is it. END
START the intruder ship, it is, sir. END
START to mister spock's station for decode switch recorder, lieutenant. END
START possibly, captain. but decode this transmission, i cannot. END
START bones, he, how is? END
START you tell me why did not? END
START done could there was nothing you have. END
START ambassador, when these attacks, you did have? END
START no witnesses, there were? END
START doctor, propose surgery for the heart defect do you? END
START because of the vulcan heart of the construction. END
START other vulcans aboard, there are. END
START yes, say that is rare, i would. END
START be possible to filter out the human factors, it should. END
START indeed. estimate the odds, i would. END
START it, i see it, spock, but rigelian, that was. END
START very similar to vulcan, rigelian physiology is. END
START good enough similar is not. still experimental, is it. END
START but look promising, it does. END
START what drug, doctor? asleep, my husband is. what drug? END
START already pulled. perfectly healthy, you are, mister spock. END
START that got, what has. END
START seem the only answer, it would. END
START in the brig questioning the andorian prisoner, i will be. END
START turn command over to scotty, you can. END
START spock, turn command over to somebody else, you must. END
START duty? to your father, your duty is. END
START as important as your father's life, nothing is. END
START oh, to him go. now. please. END
START no, my head the one inside. i, how long have. END
START not good. if only operate, could i. END
START what's stopping you? all ready, i thought you were. END
START jim, if you stand, start to bleed again, you could. END
START captain, quite all right are you? END
START get out, spock. chekov, of the intruder what's the status? END
START to the bridge call mister scott. END
START captain, moving closer, the alien vessel is. END
START belay that order. stay here, i will. END
START security? to the brig security. search the prisoner immediately. END
START going, where do you think you are? END
START see the captain, i must. END
START so your father's life is. END
START moving away. turning now. coming around again, he is. END
START as he passes fire, ensign. END
START clean miss, sir. END
START his weaponry report on, mister chekov. END
START coming around again, he is. END
START full spread missed, sir. moving too fast for us, they are. END
START off, the systems are. END
START sickbay systems put on priority, call engineering and have. END
START buckled, number four shield has, sir. END
START intended from the beginning, that was, captain. END
START andorian you are not. you, who are? END
START gone, number two shield is. END
START your own answers find, captain. long to live you have not. END
START what doing are you? END
START no. your phasers stand by, mister chekov. END
START looking us over. dead as far as he knows, are we. END
START baiting him, you are. trying to lure him in, you are. END
START he comes here. range decreasing. to sublight speed dropping close. END
START your fire hold, mister chekov. END
START to sickbay take him. END
START miscalculated, i seem to have. END
START quite through shaking the ship around are you? END
START spock, they, sarek how are? END
START all the luck, some doctors have. END
START captain, i believe, find the alien, you will. END
START i think, find he is an orion, you will, doctor. END
START but they gain by an attack on starfleet, what would? END
START had something else on your mind, you might have. END
START no, but you anyway thank. END
START i not understand. END
START for your life saving. END
START emotional, she is not? END
START always been that way, she has. END
START indeed? why marry her did you? END
START at the time, to do it seemed the logical thing. END
START doctor, return to my station now, i will. END
START at your station, you are, mister spock. END
START doctor mccoy, i believe, enjoying all this, you are. END
START indeed, captain. never seen him look so happy, i have. END
START she, how is, doc? END
START to the starfleet small thanks. END
START now really, commissioner, you, blame the starfleet, cannot. END
START i, received the proper inoculations ahead of time, should have. END
START you check your automatic scanner, will, please? END
START odd, that is. never seen anything like that before, have i. END
START i, nor have. END
START with us staying right. sensor readings, mister spock. END
START got it, have we. END
START helm answers not, captain. END
START what's happening? to know i demand. END
START your scheduled rendezvous with the enterprise, i insist you make. END
START to stay inside just how long am i supposed, captain? END
START there, a reason, must be. END
START look a little further, let us. END
START bones, get a physiological reading on that, it is whatever. END
START real enough, are we. END
START vulcan, you are, you are not? END
START human, he is human, jim. everything checks out perfectly. END
START well, know anything about that i would not. END
START you mind not if we continue to try? END
START go right ahead. got plenty of time, you have. END
START what about you, cochrane? how get here did you? END
START to notice i needed one how perceptive of you. END
START talks a lot, but he says not much. END
START noticed something else i have. END
START familiar, he looks familiar. END
START familiar? you mention it now that, he does. END
START quite place him, i cannot, but. what about miss hedford? END
START you keep it so terribly hot in here must? END
START feel hot do you? END
START infuriated, i feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged. END
START rest later, will i, doctor. END
START yes, i know. running out of time, it means we are. END
START that, what was? END
START nothing to explain, there is. END
START all right. the companion, was it. END
START injured, you were? END
START dying, i was dying, mister spock. END
START you seem perfectly all right now. the matter, what was? END
START an old man i was. END
START what, you were? END
START pretty far out story, that is. END
START mister cochrane, first name, do you have? END
START right that is, captain. END
START is your story a little improbable not, mister cochrane? END
START true, never found, his body was. END
START looking at it, you are, mister spock. END
START how you feel? END
START terrible. i feel, how should? END
START running a little temperature, you are. lie down, perhaps you should. END
START we have, how long do? END
START of hours a matter, all that is. END
START aged i have not. to that the companion sees. END
START know, i already know. END
START mind telling us you would not? END
START like it you will not. END
START i already like not it. END
START here to keep me company, you are. END
START you brought us here you mean? END
START begin to age again, i would, normally. END
START do you leave here want to? END
START got it, you have. END
START i said, very powerful, was it. END
START it cure her could? END
START know i not. END
START how communicate you with it? END
START how do you it? END
START of clear my mind and it comes i just sort. END
START bones, what make you of that? END
START of some kind almost a symbiosis, of joining a sort. END
START no, more than that, it is. END
START agreed. like love more. END
START all right are you? END
START the companion, do anything to help miss hedford, cannot. END
START then die, she will die. END
START spock! all right are you? END
START you, it attacked you? END
START you, it troubles you, cochrane? END
START also keeping you prisoner, it is. END
START it killed i want not. END
START it powerless we may simply render. END
START of view i suppose from your point, right, you are. END
START all right. to contact it you want me? END
START it ours nor. END
START that, what kind of talk is? END
START it is your fault not. END
START for use with more congruent life forms, the translator is. END
START of residual matter floating around there'd still be traces, lieutenant. END
START as she goes steady, mister sulu. END
START what think you it means, mister scott? END
START this course we stay on, see what comes up. END
START big galaxy, it is, mister scott. END
START this device what's the theory behind? END
START yes. change the entire situation, the matter of gender could. END
START way ahead of you, i am. END
START then it is a zookeeper not. END
START but i heard. END
START understand i not. END
START error when contacting http://www.yodaspeak.co.uk/index.php END
START what complaining about are you? you alive it kept. END
START that thing fed on me. me, it used me. disgusting, it is disgusting. END
START as bad as it is, you are. END
START fascinating. totally parochial attitude. END
START him, i heard him. loved and he resents it, was he. END
START companion, love the man do you? END
START understand i not. END
START part of me, he is. continue, the man must. END
START he ages not. forever, he remains forever. END
START understand i not. END
START what hope to gain by that did you, jim? END
START useless, it is useless. i know. END
START i understand not it. sick at all she is not. END
START you understand, do not? the companion, it is. END
START here, we are here. END
START companion, you have not the power to create life. END
START for the maker of all things that is. END
START dying, commissioner hedford was. END
START then both here, you are, in the one body? END
START one, we are one. END
START letting us go, you are? END
START very beautiful, you are. END
START explain many things, could i. END
START go ahead, few things to do we cochrane have. END
START mister scott, the captain, it is. END
START perfectly all right. can, a fix on us, you get. END
START computing your position now, the helm is, captain. END
START go with you, i cannot, zefram. END
START of course you can. to, you have. END
START of this hour the joy. pleased, i am pleased. END
START well, i, just fly away and leave you here, cannot. END
START free, must you be, zefram cochrane. END
START waiting, the enterprise is, mister cochrane. END
START honours enough, have i. END
START sure are you? END
START captain, tell them about me, do not. END
START specifics, doctor. labels make not arguments. END
START with gaping defects in logic i find your argument strewn. END
START i cannot, sir. END
START sir, on total override, auxiliary control is. END
START to security kirk. END
START lieutenant uhura, to the bridge have mister spock report. END
START of the intruder any sign? END
START sir, the instruments will respond not. END
START emergency manual monitor, the captain, this is. report. END
START here, allowed you are not. END
START to engineering kirk. END
START scotty, in your area, the intruder is. END
START captain, here, he is here. END
START i cannot, sir. jammed, all the controls are. END
START it will be necessary not, captain. END
START you, who are? END
START you require? we, who and what are? END
START i am programmed to respond in that area not. END
START it seems, going to take a little trip, are we. END
START any meetings or discussions, held aboard the enterprise, can be. END
START gracious invitation, i must say that is. END
START and that word, what is? END
START it i believe not. END
START welcome aboard, kirk. been a long time, it is, eh? END
START well, i am afraid, a bit of a problem there, there is. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START this man you know, captain? END
START oh, know him, do i. harcourt fenton mudd, thief. END
START swindler and con man. END
START leave you with that impression, did i? END
START that, i shall do, kirk, when ready, i am ready. END
START telling you now, am i. END
START all right, listen, i will listen. what telling are you? END
START of the same model five hundred? that seems rather redundant. END
START pay royalties to the owners of those patents did you? END
START he did pay royalties not. END
START knowledge, sir, to all should be free. END
START you know how'd? END
START that is what, have done, would i. END
START jail, he broke jail. END
START transportation, i borrowed transportation. END
START go on, with it get on, harry. END
START then unable to discern your problem, i am. END
START not, i think not, harry. END
START of them what became? END
START then of your makers survive some. END
START no, captain. of time they died over the stretch. END
START whom serve now do you? END
START free to visit them, you are. END
START we leave you, why should? END
START in much trouble, i think we are. END
START great help, that is, mister chekov. bones? END
START enjoying yourself, i trust you are, mister spock. END
START very interesting. very interesting. most unusual device, this is. END
START our central control complex, it is. END
START oh, quite understandable, that is. END
START say so, i should. END
START say, i must say, the styling i like. END
START you believe in male androids, do not, harry? END
START male? well, i suppose, their uses, have they. END
START body like that last, how long does? END
START so glad you enjoyed it, i am, doctor. END
START lose your head, do not, bones. nobody's staying anywhere. END
START be bored i would not, tell you that, i can. END
START splendid. splendid. to mudd welcome, mister scott. END
START scotty, ordered to stay aboard, you were. END
START what mean does she, the last one? END
START harry, harry, never get away with it, you will. END
START well, to stop me who's? END
START i am trying to not. END
START and alice, you are. END
START oh, well, it makes much difference not. both lovely, you are. END
START real what a shame you are not. END
START even better than leningrad, this place is. END
START and very pleasant place, it is, captain. END
START what offer you did they, uhura? END
START but unhappy here, are we. END
START no, beautiful lady, it is, and her, we love her. END
START mudd, few questions i ask you want to. END
START no longer take your orders, we can, harry mudd. END
START wise, our makers were. to serve they programmed us. END
START harry, i think, something else in mind, have they. END
START take care of them we shall. END
START your kind the whole galaxy controlled by? END
START how know you so much? END
START them, i asked them. END
START all right, we got to work with, what have? END
START i agree. direct them, what in your opinion does? END
START seem logical, that would. END
START i do, what can? END
START nothing, harry. to sleep just go. END
START oh, harry. i do believe, putting on weight, you are. END
START dying, he is dying. END
START uhura, why tell her did you? END
START it myself i half believed. END
START next, take the alices on a trip through wonderland we. END
START their captivity. enjoy the music do you? END
START better, that is, mister chekov. END
START illogical, your statement is. END
START how look does it? END
START completely inner directed. to everything oblivious. END
START you, i love you. however, you, i hate you. END
START what doing here are you? END
START to surrender i want you. END
START our burdens dying and crying and lamenting over. END
START we be happy, only this way can. END
START contradictory, that is. logical it is not. mister spock. explain. END
START have killed him you cannot. no weapons, you have. END
START how like it did you? END
START irrational, that is. illogical. dreams are real not. END
START panic, do not. women and children first. END
START be careful. want you to drop it i would not. END
START easy now. oh, caught it, is he! END
START no explosive, there is. END
START all right are you? END
START but no explosion, there was. END
START to this carefully listen, norman. lying, i am lying. END
START i am programmed to respond in that area not. END
START all immobilised, i believe they are, captain. END
START partnership arrangement? you and me? END
START got something else in mind, i have. go, let us. END
START well, very unhappy must you be, mister spock. END
START but what i do? kirk, no scientist, i am. END
START of you i call that unexpectedly civil, captain. END
START you, i order you. shut up, stella! END
START kirk, do this, you cannot. END
START one? jackson, scott and sulu, where are? END
START sorry, i am sorry. i, clear it, cannot, captain. END
START dead, the man is. END
START odd. indicate fog our probe data did not. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START the ship's sensors reading now, what are, lieutenant? END
START lieutenant, you hear me can? END
START listen. now, what think you that. END
START you, who are? END
START more useful comment, mister spock. END
START real what we have just seen is not. END
START where we are going, that is. END
START pretty real illusion, that was, mister spock. END
START to enterprise kirk. enterprise, come in. END
START and it picks up on our ship's sensors not. END
START our sensors register the life forms inside, nor do. END
START then affect spock's tricorder too, would it, it would not? END
START seem to be in order, that would. END
START for malfunctions check. END
START i did, sir, as as it happened soon. END
START do it i can, sir. i am that green not. END
START down there, we know they are. i want them found. END
START so indicate, the readings would. END
START dust, cobwebs. right, halloween is. END
START spock. all right are you? END
START yes. undamaged, i am undamaged, captain. END
START saying something about trick or treat, you were. END
START of some sort could this be an earth parallel development? END
START ghost stories, ogres, demons. the whole. END
START he collapsed neither did jackson just before. END
START going to release us, they are. END
START you, who are? why bring us here did you? END
START ancient earth legends about wizards and their familiars, there are. END
START he knows not about trick or treat. END
START hungry we are not. END
START all right, korob. what want you from us? END
START change that attitude i hopefully can. END
START valueless? i not understand. i read. END
START think a man to death you cannot. END
START do not. sylvia, do not. END
START to enterprise kirk. come in. come in. END
START the temperature, sir. rising, it keeps rising. reading, mister. END
START desalle, your heat dissipation units channel bypass power into. END
START relax now, you can, captain. safe, your ship is. END
START almost back to normal, temperature is, dropping down fast. END
START lieutenant, to raise the captain again try. END
START you name it, what would, captain? END
START yes, change the molecular structure, we can. END
START oh, we did have to know not. they knew. END
START nothing to discuss, have we. END
START it will analyse not, sir. END
START how long been has it? END
START thanks. i wonder what, doing to doc, are they. END
START to tap our conscious mind they tried. END
START sent here for, you forget what we were. END
START nothing, i forget nothing. puppet i am not, korob, like you. END
START traitor, you are. END
START duty to the old ones we have. END
START cruel, you are. you torture our specimens. END

START the power, i have. END
START this is ended not, sylvia. END
START you call not that damage? END
START i, why should? END
START to need us you seem. why? END
START very persuasive, you are. what happens if i go along? END
START your people, when here, they come here. END
START like, they are like, like feathers in the wind without the transmuter. END
START then device, it is. use tools, you do. END
START it gives only form. teaching me substance, you are. END
START you have changed your mind not? return home you will not? END
START and why not? been using me and my crew, you have. END
START any change i see not. END
START there, it is there, lieutenant. END
START leaving without my men i am not. END
START transmuter. yes, that, she mentioned that. END
START i think, stop her, can i. END
START my problem, it is. one of my kind, she is. come quickly. END
START do you think, make it, you can? END
START korob, last that door will not. END
START captain, bit more alacrity, if you please. END
START let her touch the wand, do not, captain. END
START you get tired of these games, do not? END
START never played games, i have. to me give it. END
START take some explaining that'll, bones. END
START too late. of this all, just an illusion. END
START no illusion. dead, jackson is. to enterprise kirk. come in. END
START to beam up five. END
START you pinpoint it any closer can, lieutenant? END
START sir, picking up a ship's disaster beacon, i am. END
START to raise it try, lieutenant. END
START no answer, captain. is the automatic beacon, all i get. END
START sensors recording normal energy output not. END
START the constellation, it is. look at that. END
START red alert. red alert. your battle stations man. END
START going to board her, are we. mister spock, in command, you are. END
START out, filtration systems are, sir. END
START what think you did it, sir? END
START abducted the crew was not, left, they just left. to enterprise kirk. END
START continue our search, we will. kirk out. END
START exhausted. give up without a battle they did not. END
START matt. matt, jim kirk, it is. END
START kirk. jim kirk, it is. END
START to your ship what happened, matt? END
START ship. attacked. that, that thing. END
START what thing? it, what was? END
START answer me! it, what was? what happened, matt? END
START with the duplicate log ready, sir. END
START to your crew what happened? END
START matt, your crew, where is? END
START no third planet, there is. END
START captain, our report, washburn has. END
START what look like does it? END
START both or neither. i not know. END
START to raise starfleet command due to heavy subspace interference unable. END
START robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. why? END
START we not know. an alien race, apparently from another galaxy. END
START bones, ever hear of a doomsday machine did you? END
START no. doctor, i am, not a mechanic. END
START oh, no, here, i stay here. leaving my ship i am not! END
START closing on us, it is, mister spock. END
START to beam ready, sir. END
START mister spock, communication's damaged. unable to override interference, are we. END
START i, repair warp drive without a spacedock, cannot. END
START no casualties, mister spock. we doing, how are? END
START outrun it, we have, doctor. END
START carry out my last order, you will, mister sulu. END
START destroyed, that thing must be. END
START let him do this, you cannot, spock. END
START doctor, out of line, you are. END
START certify that right now, will i. END
START then be considered valid your statement would not. END
START what about the captain? leave, we cannot leave. END
START captain, fused solid, the impulse engines' control circuits are. END
START helmsman, your course hold. stand by all phaser banks. END
START to give it a try ready? END
START scotty, you doing how? END
START it now try, captain. END
START washburn, to engineering get down. assist mister scott. END
START but you understand, do not? got to destroy it, we have! END
START break loose, we cannot! END
START got it we have not. being pulled inside, we are. END
START scotty, me that power give. END
START it, that is, mister scott. keep that power coming. END
START aye, sir. we still, move, cannot. END
START it on keep pouring, scotty. END
START captain, i still know not what we are doing. END
START phasers? got 'em, you have. one bank recharged i have. END
START loose, we are loose, commodore. END
START closing fast on the constellation, it is. END
START commodore, i suggest. END
START moving away, we are, commodore. END
START closing with us again, is it, sir. END
START mister spock, pierced the interference locally, we have. END
START you raise starfleet can? END
START matt. what's going on? me mister spock give. END
START in command here, i am, jim. END
START nothing. to regulations i assumed command according. END
START speaking to a senior officer, you are, kirk. END
START me spock give. END
START to repair warp drive how long? END
START gaining on us, it is, sir. END
START mister spock, relieve commodore decker immediately. direct order, that is. END
START commodore decker, relieved of command, you are. END
START i recognise not your authority to relieve me. END
START captain, assumed command i have. END
START accompany the commodore to sickbay, you will. END
START fine. of it just make sure you stay ahead. END
START it going keep, scotty, it going keep. mister spock. END
START too late, it is, sir. END
START to enterprise kirk. why launching a shuttlecraft are you? END
START to shuttlecraft enterprise. come in, shuttlecraft. END
START to enterprise shuttlecraft. decker here. END
START commodore, insist that you return to the ship, i must. END
START kirk, this is. matt, killed, will you be. END
START stronger with you than without you, are we! END
START gone, he is gone. constellation, come in, please. END
START regrettable that he died for nothing, is it. END
START mister spock, now operational, the transporter is. END
START transporter operational, captain. beam you aboard shall we? END
START little to be gained by staying aboard the constellation there is. END
START insufficient data. to take further sensor readings i shall try. END
START spock, you not know? END
START captain, getting dangerously close to the planet killer, you are. END
START jim, killed, will you be, like decker just. END
START calculated risk, mister spock. END
START very slim timing, thirty seconds is. END
START have to take, a chance i will. kirk out. END
START understood. mister spock. to beam scotty on board prepare. END
START with that thing what's the matter? END
START power drain somewhere, is it, sir. i almost lost you. END
START out, transporter is, captain. have to stand by, you will. END
START i cannot. power level's dropping too fast. better hurry, you would. END
START to beam me aboard on my signal prepare. END
START me aboard beam. END
START energising. bridge, shorted out again, it is. END
START och, with it what's wrong? END
START gentlemen, me aboard beam. END
START mister scott, to detonation twenty seconds. END
START sixty, fifty, forty. END
START gentlemen, me aboard i suggest you beam. END
START her now try, mister kyle. END
START bridge, him through, we got! END
START your readings start. END
START spectacular, it is spectacular, it is not? END
START shame to have to intrude, it is. END
START sure about that are you? END
START me homesick it makes. like russia just. END
START of eden more like the garden, ensign. END
START what did somebody say? like this that paradise must've looked? END
START aye, captain. shame about hendorff, is it. END
START it, what is? END
START but you say, nothing to worry about, there is? END
START well, sir, exactly say that i did not. END
START i hear, nice down there, is it. END
START indeed. for miles in all directions subsurface vibrations. END

START to the federation now i demand that you report! END
START i would, but out of communications range, we unfortunately are. END

START and forget about a certain stowaway we will. END
START apologise, we must apologise. END
START that supposed to mean, what is? END
START hippocrates would have approved of lame excuses not, doctor. END
START captain, established contact with the romulan commander, i have. END
START for this unprovoked attack i demand an explanation. END
START strange. it is on the charts not. END
START mister spock, our chances, what are? END
START after that ride, use some repairs, i could. END
START the repairs progressing, how are, scotty? END
START how like you that? so did mine. END

START when you all finish laughing, appreciate an explanation, would i. END
START captain, laugh, i never laugh. END
START no joke, this is, sir. END
START amazing. covered with ice, this deck is. END
START to one guilty party the evidence all points, captain. END
START you know who's behind these stunts you mean? END
START well, it be what'll, swim at the beach? END
START then it is woods. END
START ah, more like it that now is. shall we? END
START strange, that is. repeat the call. END
START so peaceful, is it. so relaxing. END
START and of all best, no practical jokes. END
START that, what was? END
START i am sure not. like someone chuckling it almost sounded. END
START there, again, is it. definitely laughing at us, someone is. END
START hear that right did i? END

START well, be, i will be. END
START compliance, i suggest compliance, captain. END
START with sugar on say pretty please. END

START for a nap time, old girl. captain's orders. END
START vacate sir? but. END
START you bloody big scatterbrain. your monumental mind make up. END
START we do to stop it, what can? END
START twenty below and its still dropping must the temperature be. END
START then move before we all turn into icicles, let us. END
START come on, spock. that vulcan sense of humour, where is? END
START hmm. as i thought just. END
START spock, what, what mumbling about are you? END
START but doctor, we cannot. END
START turn up the heat could you? END
START see what i can i will. END
START captain, underway, we are underway. END
START engine room reports all engines shut down, yet firing, they are firing. END
START as as our course stabilizes soon, me a reading give. END
START heading back to the neutral zone, we are. END
START decelerating, we are decelerating, sir. END
START jim, going on, what in heaven's name is? END
START as much as i do you know, bones. END
START wait a minute. method to this madness, there is. END
START elaborate, captain. END
START suggesting that the enterprise is seeking revenge are you? END
START commander, no radio response from the large ship, there is. END
START very well, refused surrender, it has. advance at attack speed. END
START giving chase, the romulans are. END
START yes, captain. take us nowhere near it, our course will. END
START good! face going through there again i could not. END
START me, it petrifies me. END
START no! we cannot! END
START my circuits! you tricked me, kirk. you, how could? END
START going on, what the devil is? END
START it is fair not. END
START responding now, the controls are. END
START yes, but later. let us spoil their fun just yet not. END
START kirk captain, almost complete, settings are. END
START commander bem, what doing here are you? END
START already set controls, this one has, mister scotty. END
START offered, assistance is. END
START all right, we are. END
START he will get far in there not. END
START have had to go through here to escape, he would. END
START i think, lost him, have we. that way. END
START yes, and gathered is bem, the food they have. END
START talking about the captain, are we. END
START our phasers work not either. END
START appear to be advisable, an alternate course of action would. END
START go back to contact mister scott, one of us could. END
START to be a model prisoner commander bem seems. END
START have to wait until nightfall, we will. END
START shut up. rescuing you we are. END
START interfering with observations, you are. END
START how you observe, this is, by being captured? END
START as as any logical a way, spock commander. END
START we always end up like this, how come? END
START i believe, the correct earth term, that is. END
START why you not try your vulcan nerve pinch. END
START captain, only a vulcan, i am. limits, there are. END
START solve our problems right now, either one could. END
START with orders is compliance. disassemble, this one must. END
START remarkable. colony creature, commander bem is. END
START lieutenant arex, found them yet have you? END
START no, sir. big planet, it is. END
START we, get any readings at all now, cannot. END

START it that is. of a long end, hard journey. END
START much green memories, i already have. END
START is this the shape of your people's primitive temples not? END
START it, what is? END
START keep working. cover you, will i. END
START hit tchar, will we. END

START what you mean? END
START we gone, how long were? END
START long? about two minutes, i guess. understand i not. END
START against all orders, it was. END
START apparently desperate, the need was. END
START the most impossible, you vulcans are, unimaginative. END
START bones, that is helping the situation not. END
START to their lot according, they beamed down six weeks ago. END
START of me careless, mister spock. planetary life forms? END
START jim, if lost, the others are, take the risk why? END

START then beam back up, will we. END
START to navigate on land it may be able. END
START it can i know. END
START get out of here let us. END

START seen stranger things, i have, mister spock. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START i not know. but at least, alive, are they. END
START apparently alive. we sure cannot be. END
START to believe they are i choose. END
START to test the water first allow me, doctor. END
START captain, too pure, the water is. END
START nonetheless, too pure, is it. END
START in other words, too good to be true, is it. END
START new terraforming is not. it implies intelligent life forms. END
START unless, of course, the pattern, the random choice is. END
START spock, ever say anything straight out do you? END
START gentlemen, please. work to do, have we. END
START still alive, are we, are we not? END
START if true, that is, spock, then. END
START been travelling for hours, have we. where taking us are they? END
START captain, it is there. END
START five square kilometres, that must be. END
START if the builders, these are, an admirable feat, is it. END
START congratulations, doctor. most logical assumption. END
START and definitely on the inside, we are. END
START communicate with them some way, surely we can. END
START you mean, some kind of a zoo, is it? END
START or maybe they see how our toys work want to. END
START possibility, that too is. END
START got to communicate with them, we have. END
START well, so for mythology much. END
START real grass, this is. END

START company, we seem to have. END
START to be getting a response you seem. END
START my impression is that, laughing at me, are they. END
START captain kirk, mister spock, nancy randolph, this is, our navigator. END
START she, how is? END
START the lactrans outside, what they do? END
START feed us or do we shift for ourselves do they. END
START to the same place always? END
START then be there, my equipment should. END
START then it that way think about, doctor. END
START food. but feeding time it is not. END
START all here, is it. damaged it they have not. END
START of the situation what's your evaluation, markel? END
START for the curators of a zoo a natural reaction. END
START how? get through to them we cannot? END
START telepathically, they communicate telepathically. END
START between themselves, yes, but, mister spock, are vulcans telepathic not? END
START how much learned have you? END
START of us what's their impression? END
START with another move how about coming up, then? END
START if suggest, i may suggest, sir? END
START little one, it is. child, could be. END
START enterprise, captain kirk, this is. beam us aboard. END
START worried about the enterprise, am i. END
START well, stand here let us not. do something, let us. END
START argh, the best thing we can do is! END
START it, what is? END
START i think, harmless, is it, but sure i am not. END
START me to whatever it wants. END
START jim, all right are you? END
START yes. so, i think so. END
START hold out against that many, i cannot. END
START all right, i am. scotty, what doing here are you? END
START with me it made contact. END
START what learn did you? END
START then how get here did you? END
START what else know about us do they? END
START of here do we get out? END
START to transport everyone ready? END
START offhand, say we learned to keep our hands off, would i. END
START but so much more, there was. END
START welcome back, we will be, in twenty or thirty centuries. END
START either way, mister spock, hardly be our problem, will it. END
START why glowing like that is it? END
START mister sulu, our position, what is? END
START carrying a stasis box detector, maybe no one else was. END
START bring us about. investigate the beta lyrae system, will we. END
START we are tourists here not, lieutenant. END
START we, where are? END
START kzinti spacecraft. END
START then really working for the kzinti government, you are. END
START of a slaver could that be a picture? END
START the human, sulu, to be a slaver believes it. END
START mister spock, move, i can move. END
START so can i. off, the police web is. END
START mister spock, we. END
START the weapon, i have. END
START no, they cannot. or rather, not, will. END
START but seen all the phases we have. END
START to another setting it may be the key. END
START wrong. much of you they think not. END
START no. see what this does do, let us. END
START give them that we cannot! END
START no idea, i have. generating power, is it. END
START the kzinti frightened, it has. END
START the kzint, legends of weapons haunted by their owners, have i. END
START without certain code words, i may describe our location not. END
START the null position, twist me widdershins until you reach. then. END
START got it, have they. END
START something we can do, must there be. END
START that was the total conversion beam setting not. END
START let them have that weapon we cannot. END
START they are about to get it not, lieutenant. END
START disrupter field. END
START this rate at, never get over those old superstitions, will they. END
START that thing, what the devil was? END
START regaining consciousness, it is. surface, mister clayton. END
START spock, to fire phasers prepare. END
START to enterprise kirk. emergency. END
START under attack, we are. beam us aboard, scotty. END
START repeat, lost contact we have. come in, captain. come in. END
START nothing, there is. just nothing, there is. END
START still alive, they maybe are. END
START functioning, their bodies are. metabolism, heart. everything but the lungs. END
START breathe, cannot. suffocating. help. breathe cannot. END
START to them what happened, doctor? it, what is? END
START somehow accomplished naturally are you sure the mutation was not? END
START highly sophisticated and completely unknown to us, it is. END
START intelligent life forms on argo, that implies there are. END
START what about you, spock? your logic tell you, what does? END
START make contact as soon as possible, we will, mister scott. END
START go away, air breathers. wanted here you are not. END
START we will harm you not. friends, we are friends. END
START understand i not. they said, saved us once, would they. END
START that building in the centre. to be important it seems. END
START nothing without consulting the ancient records, can we do? END
START correct, rila is. you may speak. END
START on the surface places you live not? END
START this world not on. END
START scott here. it, what is, doctor? END
START you contact them sooner can? END
START yes. examine the wreckage before we make judgement, let us. END
START news, we have news, high tribune. END
START still believe these creatures came in peace do you? END
START we know not what to believe. END
START to the big island go. bring assistance party. END
START see anything did you? END
START of them not a sign. wait a minute. who are. END
START your race evolved from its ancient enemies that suggests. END
START violent would strange that such a highly developed race be. END
START then possible, reverse mutation is. END
START the ruins, how far are, rila? END
START another chamber there is. END
START of the antitoxin what's the composition, bones? END
START nephro, break the ordainments, we must. END
START quickly, leave, we must leave. END
START no, no, no time, there is. END
START well, get started, let us. END
START how you feel, jim? END
START little dizzy. otherwise normal. END
START i did believe such knowledge was possible not. END
START start in three minutes, major tremors will, captain. END
START incredible, it is incredible. of it all. END
START as directed fire phasers, gentlemen. END
START then safe, our people are. END
START stabilize within a few hours, the seabed should. END
START lose contact with each other like your ancestors, do not. END
START pass ordainments to forbid it, we will. END
START and we, this time, ignore them will not. END
START nonetheless, have it on the record let us. END
START correct, your information is. captain kirk, this is. END
START sir, are we going to defend ourselves not? END
START doing that for us, your deflector shields are, mister scott. END
START dead on, sir. we, there in ten seconds, will be. END
START captain, just gone out, our deflector shields have. END
START dead, subspace radio channels are, sir. END
START where go did they? END
START tell, i cannot tell, sir. focus vision will not. END
START we, where are, sir? END
START aye, and that tricky devil, where is? END
START totally depleted, scanners indicate the enterprise shields are, sir. END
START sir, frozen, our weaponry is. END
START to elysia welcome. devna, of laws interpreter. END
START how freeze my weaponry did you? END
START getting out we are. END
START then pretty quick, we'd better do it, captain. END
START if we find an answer, still take time, will it. END
START that is just what we have got not. END
START our dilithium crystals, it is, sir. deteriorating rapidly, they are. END
START your computer got any miracles in, spock? END
START to predict impossible, captain. END
START what see you beyond your eyes, magen? END
START gently, good magen. to us now return. END
START impossible, it is impossible. END
START covered every possibility have you? every factor? END
START his crew and his ship unnecessarily jeopardising? END
START but with the klothos this involves combining our ship. END
START correct, that is. END
START good. contact kor right away, will i. END
START it, what is? END
START it is against our laws to try to escape not. END
START they die even if? END
START their choice, is it. END
START forgive me, commander. overcome by the moment, i was. goodbye. END
START the stories of his being half human, true, must be. END
START his mind perhaps the time continuum affected. END
START become affected i wonder if we all have not. END
START think my commander had manoeuvred brilliantly i would. END
START and it, arranged, can be, practically speaking? END
START your pardon beg, sir. END
START it, what is, gabler. END
START lost, we were lost. END
START jim, worried about spock, i am. he is just acting normal not. END
START under much pressure, he is, bones. END
START talk to him, will i, bones. all i can do, it is. END
START yes, captain. why you ask? END
START the device, you have, kaz? END
START go, you could. willing to take passengers, are we. END
START done, we believe it can be. END
START then interfere with your dream i shall not, captain. END
START get away from here, human. my woman, this is. END
START fail, you will. END
START take these renegades with you, you would? END
START them, we need them. END
START to accelerate to warp six ready. END
START enterprise, xerius, this is! come in, enterprise. END
START sir, calling us, xerius is. he says, urgent, is it. END
START go off, will it when you reach warp eight. END
START it is there, sir. END
START it matters not, bones. END
START what matters, that is. END
START entering its cycle of strongest emissions, arachna is, captain. END
START it on the speaker put. END
START signals appear random. beyond our reception capability, perhaps some are. END
START natural radio source newly energised by, could be. END
START intersat? been out of use for two centuries, that is. END
START no, sir. repeated twice in the transmission, it was. END
START mister sulu, for cepheus lay in a course. END
START waste of time if you ask me, it is. END
START for a single elliptic orbit set. END
START to engineering bridge. scotty, your engines, how are? END
START like happy kittens purring, captain. END
START nothing, jim. of shock the gossamer mice show no signs. END
START know yet, do not. END
START but the hardest, dilithium molecules are, most rigid. END
START mister scott! with the circuit work more trouble. END
START you sound like, blathering, you are, man. wait, coming, i am coming. END
START spock, slumping are you? END
START captain, happening, the most incredible thing is. END
START we know. apparently expanded, the whole ship has. END
START complex beyond anything in my experience, only that it is. END
START kirk here. how holding out are they, scotty? END
START to sickbay kirk. END
START bones, i need some answers. to us what's happening? END
START the test tissue, there is, jim, with the stable infrared compared. END
START then right, spock's theory is. contracting, we are contracting. END
START agreed. and accelerating, it is accelerating. END
START it keep on, how long can? END
START miss chapel, the composition of this decoration, what is? END
START are all our uniforms xenylon not? END
START yes, and all been shrinking proportionately with us, they have. END
START affected, that means only organic matter is. but how? END
START the strands would break not, jim, just quit winding, would they. END
START then calculate the limits to our shrinkage, we can. END
START possible, it is possible. feed the data into the computer banks, i will. END
START spock, we ultimately shrink, how small will? END
START sulu! his leg's broken i think. need a splint, we will. END
START get him to sickbay, let us. to stations every one back. END
START certainly worth a try, it is. END
START in the lab shelf supplies, it is. get it, will i. END
START for you no more climbing heights, nurse. got that clear? END
START yes, captain. but also got the miniature laser, i have. END
START it, how is, sulu? END
START feel it knitting i can, sir. END
START through, results on dna reduction limits have come, captain. END
START they, what are? END
START of thirty two point nine factor. END
START yes, captain. of enterprise controls well past the operative point. END
START as good a place as any to beam down, is it. END
START to engineering kirk. scotty, you hear me can? END
START i think i see. END
START scotty, you is it? END
START captain, deafen us for sure, you will! END
START done to my people, you forbid me after what you have? END
START my officers, where are? END
START spock, the terratins, who are? from, where'd they come? END
START bridge crew, to beam up prepare. END
START subspace radio now operational, sir. reading, starbase twenty three is. END
START mister arex, for immediate departure from this area prepare. END
START to making it more than honorary we came rather close. END
START think harry mudd is down there do you, spock? END
START you just say why cannot, mudd's probably there. END
START did, i just did, doctor. END
START harry, darling. lonely for you, i was. END
START please, darling, to the ship with me come back. END
START three hundred credits, or the. END
START with free will i surrender myself. of the law mercy. END
START fine. see you in court, i will, harry. END
START minor bruise, captain. live, he will live. END
START and to swindle honest miners came here. END
START really a very attractive intelligence, your mister spock is. END
START it, what is? END
START think about it, darling. with you mister spock in love. END
START let you know the results of my analysis, i will. END
START it, what is? END
START absorbed, a temporary effect as the liquid is. END
START better, i feel better. END
START did i tell you not? END
START you should, be in the brig, you should, harry. END
START oh, you are right, darling. END
START injured are you, miss chapel? END
START no. no, i, fine, i am fine. feeling all right are you? END
START you like me to would not, well, stay? help you? END
START be illogical that would, miss chapel. END
START yes. yes, stupid would it be. END
START harry mudd, you swindling. END
START come to collect on your guarantee i have, mister mudd. END
START completely successful you are implying the potion was not? END
START it on screen put. END
START mudd. and christine, he has christine. in danger, she is. my love. END
START going planet side, is he. END
START no. with my christine not. END
START spock, yourself you are obviously not. maybe some rest. END
START then transport down with you, i will. END
START jim, is that wise, his condition in? END
START jim, this in the shuttlecraft bay the search party found. END
START of mudd's love crystals one. END
START lucky for us they not work. END
START it out check, bones. me an immediate report send. END
START well, planned on it i had not. END
START thanks jim. good to have a friend like you, it is. END
START darling, all right are you? END
START kirk, of here get us out. END
START responding they are not. END
START worry, do not. safe will you be, darling. END
START coming closer, are they. END
START my affair, that is. END
START get a few things straight, i think we should. END
START yes, to control our emotional reactions, have we. END
START the effect of the potion last, how long does, harry? END
START harry, any of the crystals left, do you have? END
START contact, i made contact. END
START you record his confession may i help, nurse? END
START you? you would be the last person, choose, would i. END
START guarantee it, i can. END
START yes, as beautiful as i remembered it just. nothing's changed. END
START you so very much thank. END
START real it is hard to believe they are not. END
START lovely. them like that anymore they just make not. END
START with his head off. with his head off! END
START to transporter room uhura. the emergency, what is? respond, please. END
START i see. bones, you thinking about that book were? END
START mister sulu, experience any strange occurrences did you? END
START somewhere underground, his quarters are, are they not? END
START be, any indication of where that would? END
START you are being detained so your master will leave not. END
START your name for it, that is. END
START why think you the enterprise is my master? END
START redundant, your questioning is. END
START word meaning to cease to function, that is? END
START built like a fortress, this planet is. END
START enterprise, read me do you? END
START to bridge scott. of phaser bore commencing beam down. END
START to bridge scott. got problems, we have. END
START an inscription, there is, several languages. END
START well, gentlemen, it appears that, on our own now, are we. END
START been changed before, programmes have, lieutenant. END
START believe me. no reason to harm them there is. END
START they serve the sky machine, but essential they are not. END
START oh, but they are. most essential, they are. END
START attempt to disconnect me, do not. END
START with your function you sound less than enchanted. END
START what you want, signs pointing the way? END
START doctor, i only meant it seems like, wasting time, are we. END
START sorry, i am sorry, sulu. worried about uhura i am. END
START dead, phasers are! for the cave run! END
START to amuse our amusement park no longer seems content. END
START please, call off that beast. why doing this are you? END
START mister arex, what doing are you? END
START to that i believe you may know the answer, doctor. END
START me? what talking about are you? END
START and to or not whether it wants. END
START perfect, bones. which arm want do you? END
START i submit, captain, that, the more qualified subject, am i. END
START for one thing my knowledge of computers. END
START and for another his tough vulcan hide. END
START your arguments seem sound both. go ahead, bones. END
START i believe, find ten cc's adequate, you will. END
START been almost five minutes, it is, captain. END
START of mechanical nursemaid it looks like some kind. END
START i think of that, not in my wildest dreams would! END
START visitor, have we. END
START got to make those rocks, we have. our only chance, it is. END
START i presume, the planet's master computer, you are. END
START to the keeper what happened? END
START old, he was old. to function he ceased. END
START sky machines? slaves? what talking about are you? END
START new computer! END
START dead end, is it! END
START masters of the sky machine, you are? END
START shock, this is. END
START mister scott, now functioning normally, all systems are. END
START here, we must have more of these discussions while you are. END
START mister spock, to take on that duty would you care? END
START find it most interesting, i would, captain. END
START then agreed, it is agreed. to enterprise kirk. END
START reverse power. our position hold. deflector screens on. END
START deflectors up. sir, taking considerable power to hold position, it is. END
START everything, repaired, can be, captain. END
START an incredible experience, captain. this scientifically fascinating i find. END
START ride her through, will we, bones. we do, what else can? END
START her through where ride? END
START we, where are? END
START captain, the subspace radio. dead, it is dead. END
START stopped, even the ship's chronometers have. END
START ship's life support systems fading. jim, oxygen, we need oxygen. END
START jim, got to do something we have. END
START ah, humans. lovely primitive humans. you do anything right cannot? END
START working, everything is, my friends. END
START it cannot. it is logical not. END
START look around you, spock. working, everything is. END
START welcome! searching for me, i knew eventually humans would come. END
START you, who are? END
START this all quite absorbing i find, doctor. END
START probably because you are not very natural to begin with, spock. END
START play, children will. END
START you superstitiously call magic our universe operates by what. END
START just my imagination but, i know this is. END
START love philter? END
START it, what is? what's wrong? END
START captain kirk, what. END
START all right, everyone onboard is? END
START mister scott, bewildered, i am bewildered, all, that is. but enough, that is. END
START if it there lucien put. END
START weapons status, mister scott? to protect ourselves, we may have. END
START forget it, spock. work it will not. END
START what doing are you? END
START to protect ourselves learning, lucien. END
START but you made mistakes, your powers used. END
START and for it burned. burned! END
START and loneliness and fear. END
START i will, asmodeus. of earth i am not. END
START yes, different, you are. hear a defence, the court will. END
START as my first witness i call lucien. END
START indeed, captain. elaborate could you? END
START submit, captain. the power to fight us you have not. END
START captain, you know use the magic. believe. END
START understand i not. END
START all systems go, captain. back to normal, are we. END
START really matter does it? END
START confused, life readings are, sir. i, decipher them, cannot. END
START it, what is, mister sulu? END
START going to have to see this yourself, you are, sir. END
START that thing, what is? END
START ow! been a thorn, must have. END
START been poisoned, he is. unknown toxin. END
START you help him can? END
START get a correlation with any known poison i cannot. END
START that will be necessary not. END
START you, who are? END
START called agmar i am. help, i believe we can. END
START getting a reading on them are you? END
START moment, captain. unclear, the results are. END
START captain, of botanical origin, these beings are. END
START so seem, it would seem. END
START to the planet phylos welcome. END
START to him what happened? END
START minor achievement. END
START been humanoid aliens here before, there have. END
START of communication your method. END
START come. show you, will i. END
START happening, we had no way of knowing what was. END
START alive then, you were? END
START they will work on any setting not, sir. END
START i think, after you, is it, jim. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START what think you they will do with us, sir? END
START sorry, i am sorry, captain kirk, but no other way, there was. END
START what talking about are you? where taken spock have they? END
START spock, where is? END
START my first officer not without. END
START to enterprise kirk. beam us up, scotty. END
START hate to resort to clubs and knives, i would. END
START aye, sir, but i like not it. END
START i, neither do, but to be necessary it appears. energise. END
START sure i can take too much of this i am not. END
START believe it i cannot. END
START getting ready to go on a trip, looks like they are. END
START agmar said, a peaceful people, were they. END
START they are sure, now. but what about before? END
START of keniclius or spock any indication? END
START your work carry on? END
START to spock or the master what if something happens? END
START like that just, captain? END
START though here, the way is, gentlemen. END
START hear something did you? END
START i am sure not. END
START much further now not, captain. END
START operate they not. agmar! END
START it, i see it. it, i see it. keep going. END
START dying, he is dying. to his brain something's happened. electrical activity decreasing. END
START captain, out, i am out. empty, the chemical sprayer is. END
START of my way out, mister. an order, that is. END
START no use, is it, mister scott. i, get through, cannot. END
START our ship calling that is, spock. you answer them. END
START slipping away, spock is. there is much time left not. END
START sure we are getting through, i am, but they are acknowledging not. END
START what i call close, that is, mister scott. END
START hope it was information they could use, let us. END
START no! broken must the mould be. END
START spock: i believe not so. END
START no! our dream must be allowed to die not. END
START murderer! killed spock, you have! END
START spock. spock, you old. END
START be honoured i would. if allowed, will i be. END
START inscrutable? sulu, the most scrutable man i know, you are. END
START identified the vessel have you, mister spock? END
START impossible that is, spock. over five years carter winston's been missing. END
START incredible. him, it is him. END
START you gentlemen know me it seems. END
START my fiancee? this starship anne's aboard? END
START right as usual, spock is, bones. END
START are you suggesting i am quite human not, doctor? END
START completed, the captain is inquiring if the examination is, doctor. END
START yes, so, i suppose so. END
START sorry, i am sorry, anne. meet again, i never thought we would. END
START carter, it, what is? END
START but survive, you did. alive, you are, and together again, we are. END
START intruding i hope i am not, captain. END
START no, come in, mister winston. END
START weren't you your cabin going to, sir? END
START mister sulu, for ratar three lay in a direct course. END
START the order, that was, helmsman. END
START an admirable mission, captain, but our ship if we endanger. END
START been his reputation, that has. END
START the conn, you have, mister spock. END
START take the conn i will, mister spock. END
START the reason you gave, i believe that was, captain. END
START examine you, perhaps doctor mccoy should, captain. END
START doctor, what i do? i still love him. END
START not, i have not. i do, what can? END
START i do for you, what can, captain? END
START i want a complete medical examination, bones. something's just happened. END
START there are many places one could hide in here not. END
START taken a little nap, i must have. END
START something wrong about this room, there is. END
START so i think not, doctor. END
START that, i saw that, but it i believe not. END
START to bridge spock. me on ship's audio put. END
START anne, what doing are you? END
START lieutenant nored, you, stopped him, could have. you fire why did not? END
START bridge, the captain, this is. what's happened? END
START it was deliberate not, you, i assure you. END
START like a few minutes to inform my crew, would i. END
START seem so, would it. END
START surrender my ship i will not. END
START what doing are you? END
START captain, coming down, our deflector shields are. END
START to engineering bridge. scotty, to the shields what's happened? END
START mister scott is here not, sir. END
START him, we need him. override the controls and shut those doors. END
START it take to fix, how long will? END
START carter? what say did he? END
START how die did he? END
START so much like him, you are, his voice, his mannerisms. END
START say he loved me, did he. END
START but unfortunately, i cannot. END
START without deflectors, just a clay pigeon for them, we are. END
START suggest capitulation, practicality does, captain. END
START captain, coming up again, the deflector shields are. END
START only one shield, that is. END
START yes, sir, but between us and the romulans, it is. END
START someone tell me what's going on, will? END
START that, what manner of beastie is? END
START over, i assume the danger to your ship is. END
START why do it did you? END
START your mind about the romulans what changed? END
START happen to me now, what will? END
START captain, assign me that duty could you. END
START but seem me, you have. you know what i am. END
START know i not. i. END
START the guard detail, you have, lieutenant. END
START firing on him, are they. END
START him, they got him. END
START scotty, that pilot yet, you have got? END
START dead, our engines are. END
START the phasers not work, sir. END
START well, always throw rocks, we could. END
START scotty, get that pilot did you? END
START but integrate him i cannot. the system's been discoordinated. END
START captain, message coming in, i have, sir. END
START it on the viewscreen put. END
START my ship release. END
START that, what was? lieutenant, cut off that frequency. END
START power, they still have? we still control them? END
START captain, afford to lose that grain, you cannot. END
START incredible. require, the amount of energy that field must. END
START maintain the stasis field they could not. END
START down, apparently their battle capacity is. they only damaged it. END
START veering off, they are. END
START scotty, you integrate that pilot now can? END
START so, i think so, captain. END
START to the transporter room call mccoy. spock. END
START have, him, you got? END
START to be it appears. END
START to think about it i want not. END
START and got tribbles with him, he is. tribbles! END
START captain, safe tribbles, these are. END
START no such thing as a safe tribble, there is. END
START well, at least, neat, is it. END
START the klingons chasing you, why were, jones? END
START i know, how should? notoriously bad tempers, klingons have. END
START mention ecological sabotage, they did. END
START me? saboteur? ridiculous. END
START pretty emphatic, captain koloth was. END
START what do did you? END
START well, i did know it was a klingon planet not. END
START captain, we talk this over could not? think so i did not. END
START he really seems the saboteur type not, jim. END
START captain, picking up a klingon battle cruiser, sensors are. END
START quite a marksman, captain koloth is. END
START changed course, they have. coming in again, they are. END
START perhaps they have had enough time to recharge it not. END
START or something else, the purpose of the attack was. END
START well, mister spock, any ideas, you have? END
START always throw tribbles at them, we could. END
START i thought vulcans did have a sense of humour not. END
START not, we do not, captain. END
START of captain koloth's ship any sign? END
START mister jones, in enough trouble already, you are. END
START captain, harmless little tribble. they hurt, what can? END
START hungry, they are hungry, captain. END
START captain, coming back, the klingons are. END
START of the devil speak. END
START jim, something about these tribbles, there is. END
START done it that is. caught, we are caught. END
START help it, not if i can. END
START are you going to sit down not, sir? END
START i think, stand, will i. END
START mister scott, going to implement emergency defence plan b, are we. END
START yet you know not, do you? END
START others, you must have. END
START they completely overrun the planet jones sold before. END
START and all you want that is? END
START the glommer, we must have. END
START my claim i withdraw. END
START captain, filled with tribble, the engine room is. END
START five seconds. four, three. END
START it on ship's speaker put. END
START more like music than a message, is it. END
START captain, being probed, we are. END
START from where? you trace it can? END
START you identify it can? END
START to be calling us it seems. END
START strange. yes, the same feeling myself, i get. END
START resemble a summons, it does. END
START to a summons i find no resemblance, captain. END
START you wanted me, lieutenant? all right are you? END
START logically, we must assume, created by the probe, are they. END
START sir, what visions? anything we see not. END
START miss chapel, you see not anything, either? END
START no, i think not so, carver. do it, spock will. END
START something compelling about it, there is. END
START yes, it too i feel, bones. END
START no apparent danger, there is, spock. go, let us. END
START here, they are here. END
START oh, such wondrous ones. us, they honour us. END
START how know you our names? END
START the signal? distress call, was it not? END
START to the slumber chambers take them. rest, they must rest. END
START probably that nectar. potent as saurian brandy, it is. END
START of medical summation, biological, astrophysical scans. END
START to security officer davison lieutenant uhura. END
START what doing are you? END
START of this ship taking command. END
START return to our duties aboard ship, we must. END
START yes. duties. it, that is. duties. i have. END
START go, we must go. END
START of you very thoughtful, love. END
START me keep it i wonder why they let. END
START they saw no practical use in it perhaps. END
START cortropine. could help. strong stimulant, it is. END
START the urn. the only place, is it. END
START they are here not, theela. END
START actually draining our life forces, you mean they are? END
START we have, how long do, spock? END
START to be aging ten years per day we seem, captain. END
START ten years? in four days, dead, we will be! END
START to enterprise spock. END
START greetings. theela, i am theela. of this compound head female. END
START to your ship return. you are wanted here not. END
START until we find captain kirk, we will leave not. END
START search the temple. of two parties. END
START of them anywhere no sign. END
START it, what is? END
START spock, it is spock. there, a panel somewhere, must be. END
START got to get out of here, have we. END
START that, we tried that. END
START wait! tell you everything, i will. END
START see, we shall see. of the enterprise the men, reveal them. END
START drowning, they are drowning! they, where are? END
START many cusecs from here, the nearest water accumulation is. END
START like a pool or a tub that looks. END
START the urn in the garden, it is. END
START no results, captain. tried everything we know, have we. END
START the key, perhaps the transporter is. END
START to what key? END
START but never been done before, this has. it fails suppose? END
START scotty, losing them, we are! END
START work did it? END
START more handsome than ever, you are. END
START tell captain kirk, kept the agreement, have we. END
START we become as other women, how quickly will? END
START only take a few months, doctor mccoy says it should. END
START captain, now approaching sensor range of the cloud, we are. END
START our present position put up, lieutenant arex. END
START captain, disappeared from navigation scan, alondra has. END
START come between us and the planet could the cloud have. END
START spock, possible the cloud consumes planets is it? END
START sir, changing course, the cloud is. END
START but it continues on that course if. END
START how much time have do they? END
START certain there'd be planetwide panic, is it. END
START of mantilles who's the governor, jim? END
START captain, getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors, i am. END
START still got us, is it. END
START to fire all phasers into cloud mass prepare. END
START firing. no effect, captain. END
START to absorb the phaser energy the cloud appeared, captain. END
START floating inside the cloud, we are. END
START some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter, the objects are. END
START scotty, for an antimatter charge prepare the shields. END
START to my quarters transfer it. END
START time to save some people, you have, bob. END
START how are you choose going to? END
START reached the entrance to the central core, have we, captain. END
START what we do now, knock? END
START those things, what are? END
START we have, how much time do? END
START to maximum increase deflector shields. END
START to maximum screens, sir. END
START scotty, got ten minutes left, have we. END
START holding, the force field is. go, let us. END
START the brain located, where is? END
START captain, living creature, this is. starfleet regulations. END
START i believe, what i just said, that is, doctor. END
START to engineering kirk. END
START incoming message, sir. governor wesley of mantilles, it is. END
START it on the viewscreen put, lieutenant. END
START to mantilles thirty one minutes and four seconds, sir. END
START bob, katie, where is? END
START worry, do not, bon. all right, will she be. goodbye. END
START in time, can you do it? END
START to mantilles twenty six minutes exactly, sir. END
START ready, the procedure is, sir. END
START mantilles, how near is, mister arex? END
START your order awaiting, captain. END
START stopped, the cloud has, sir. END
START spock, it, you did! leaving, the cloud is. END
START mister sulu, get out of here, let us, through that grid. END
START spock, what perceive did you? END
START of the universe the wonders, captain. incredible, completely incredible. END
START returning, the travellers are. END
START what you mean, who's he? you know mister spock. END
START not, afraid i do, jim. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START you, who are? END
START no, but if, reality, is it, what happened? END
START but changed, something was. END
START also research the vulcan family history requested did you? END
START correct that is not. END
START in this case, it is. END
START to thirty vulcan years past twenty. END
START the date was. END
START of tasmeen the twentieth day. END
START how know you this? END
START this cousin, his name, what was? END
START spock, now, did selek look like you do? END
START all, i hear all. END
START possible if no other major factor is changed, is it. END
START andorians are known for their charity not. END
START ready to receive you, the time and place are. END
START spock: true that is not. my father. END
START peace and long life. of my family, you are? END
START honoured, i am honoured. is something wrong, cousin? END
START to our forefathers a family resemblance, no doubt. END
START to understand him better than my husband you seem. END
START but the twentieth day of tasmeen, tomorrow is. END
START lost track of time, i seem to have. END
START sarek, gone, our son and the visitor are. END
START you think not he would harm spock? END
START my duty, it was, spock. END
START spock: always say thank you, mother says you should. END
START known for her graciousness, the lady amanda is. END
START you will i dare say. come now. END
START your father's wish, that is? END
START spock: how know did you? END
START spock: dying is he? END
START spock: bring a healer here, i can. END
START late, the hour is. urgent, i trust your errand is? END
START spock, you are, of sarek son, not are you? END
START spock: healer, hurry. END
START be long now it will not, old friend. END
START face such a loss without tears, a vulcan would. END
START spock: do, is there nothing you can? END
START i trust you can explain why, necessary, was it? END
START returning, the traveller is. END
START to the ship i sent the others up. what happened? END
START changed this time, one small thing was. pet died. END
START enterprise, the captain, this is. to beam up two. END
START to reverse course stand by. END
START captain, the source of the radio emissions that is. END
START captain, still gaining speed, we are. END
START no good, sir. still falling toward it, we are. END
START we have, how much time do? END
START captain, another signal there is. listen. END
START as she goes steady, mister sulu. maintain orbit. END
START slingshot effect, mister spock? enough power, have we? END
START need some time for the computations, will i, captain. END
START coming from that ship, is it, captain. END
START sure, you are, mister spock? END
START mister spock, of that ship's power source any indication? END
START now we a lighter and stronger material than anything have. END
START look, every pod, all been burst open, they have. END
START aye, from the inside, of them from the looks. END
START been some accident to get almost every pod, must have. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START negative, captain. transmitting, it stopped transmitting when you beamed aboard. END
START what make you of it, spock? END
START me the creeps gives. like something's watching us i feel. END
START it too i feel, captain. END
START enterprise, read me do you? sulu? END
START cut our way out of here, we can. END
START you mean, trapped here, are we? no communication, nothing? END
START to shield this room something. but it from what shield? END
START aboard their ship, possibly from whatever had come. END
START quite right, mister scott. of life no known form. END
START it hold, will? END
START it, what is? END
START sure i am not, but i think. END
START message from three hundred million years ago? END
START to get a translation i may be able. END
START of here get out! hurry! END
START of cake piece, sir. now, here they come. END
START captain, with you something's beamed aboard. END
START it back out transport. END
START to crew sickbay reports no injuries, sir. END
START to hull or engines no damage, captain. END
START of a heart like the beating. END
START to sickbay bridge. END
START something's jammed the circuits. magnetised, they are magnetised. END
START you, i thank you, sir. END
START off, phaser banks were, captain. themselves, they activated themselves. END
START and mutual override did work not? END
START sir, get into the core, we cannot. END
START of all energy drained, sir. END
START have a very small field, would it. END
START activated, it is activated, captain, but only an area three metres square. END
START get a magnetic flux reading there now do you? END
START absorbed the memory banks, it has, captain, of them all. END
START extinguished, all nonessential systems are. obey me, you will. END
START stop! hurt him, you will. END
START obey, i will obey. let him go. END
START all right i am, captain. END
START we dealing with, what are, spock? END
START the heart of the galaxy, that is, captain. END
START aware of that, i am, mister spock. END
START to activate auxiliary controls ready, captain. END
START only be operated manually, the auxiliary warp drive controls can. END
START correct, that is. activate the manual controls, you will. obey! END
START to activate warp drive unit standby. END
START gone is it? END
START interesting. of magnetic storms in this sector no indications. END
START manned by vulcans, the intrepid is, is it not? END
START yes, right that is, bones. END
START it, what is, spock? in pain are you? END
START come on, spock, go down to sickbay, let us. END
START to the sickbay get. END
START no, no, no. an order, that is. END
START dead, it is dead. END
START it die i sensed. END
START feel a starship die, not even a vulcan could. END
START rendered your history a bit less bloody, it might have. END
START i, filter out the distortion, cannot, sir. getting worse, is it. END
START to warp three slow. END
START we looking for, exactly what are, mister spock? END
START assume that, i would. END
START that, what is? END
START hold present course. to warp one slow. END
START aye, sir. probe ready. to library computer switching data feed. END
START that, what was? END
START the telemetry probe, sir. no signal from it, there is. END
START none, i have none, captain. insufficient data. END
START just dizzy i am. all right, will i be. fine, i am fine, sir. END
START kirk here. it, what is? END
START not unless, feeling ill, is she. got an emergency here, i have. END
START giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet, am i. END
START good. kirk out. our position hold, mister kyle. END
START spock, me an update on the dark area ahead give. END
START to insufficient information no analysis due. END
START so much help far that is not. END
START all right i am. of darkness distance from zone, mister kyle? END
START to starfleet complete transmission, sir. END
START of the zone in one minute penetration, seven seconds, sir. END
START it is coming from communications not, sir. END
START captain, gone, the stars are! END
START then to the stars kindly tell me what happened. END
START to mccoy kirk. END
START asking how, i am, mister. answers, i want answers. kirk out. END
START bones, it, how bad is? END
START affected, two thirds of the personnel are. END
START why? how? any answers, do you have? END
START and where we are, between where we were. END
START trying to be funny are you, mister spock? END
START never occur to me, it would, captain. END
START any ideas, you have, spock? END
START to captain kirk sickbay. END
START jim, to the life indicators according, the energy levels. END
START to the life monitors according, dying, we are dying. END
START all right are you? END
START that, what was? END
START he just gave us reverse power. forward, we lurched forward. END
START doctor. life function indicators. started a sharp drop again, have they. END
START what you think, scotty? forward thrust? END
START doctor, to be stabilising they seem. END
START it you sensed, what was? END
START of death the touch. END
START and what think you they felt? END
START it, that ought to do. to captain kirk engineering. END
START kirk here. it, what is, scotty? END
START to try it ready when you are, sir. END
START the power to pull it off, do we have, scotty? END
START to launch a probe prepare, mister chekov. END
START aye, sir. for launch probe ready, sir. END
START impact in seven point three seconds, probe will. END
START with the probe are we still in contact? END
START yes, sir. to mister spock data being relayed. END
START an amoeba that is. END
START send one man in, we could, pinpoint its vulnerable spots. END
START suicide mission, it is. END
START it first and died the vulcans saw. END
START just because the vulcans failed. END
START more capable, am i. END
START gentlemen, i am taking volunteers not. END
START you are going you think not? END
START better qualified as a command pilot than you are, am i. END
START gentlemen, decide, i will decide. END
START to captain kirk engineering. END
START very well. for launching prepare the shuttlecraft. END
START right. get a few things i need, will i, jim. END
START then of your own superstitions employ one. me luck wish. END
START for shuttlecraft launch all systems clear. sir. END
START lieutenant uhura, to the computers channel automatic telemetry directly. END
START enormous and growing worse, power drain is. END
START you bet want to? END
START spock, for the shields save your power. END
START last only forty seven minutes, calculations indicate the shields will. END
START of those things you mean there'll be two? END
START spock, read me do you? spock, read me do you? END
START captain, getting telemetry i am. END
START mister chekov, as it comes in telemetry analysis. END
START we have, how much time do? END
START it on put, lieutenant. END
START how you feel? END
START your mind what's on? END
START scotty, how much power do, left, have we? END
START exactly. to divert power on my signal prepare. kirk out. END
START have, something to say, you got? END
START through, we are through, sir. END
START aware of that, i believe everybody is, mister chekov. END
START captain, only twenty six percent power reserves after entry, we have. END
START impulse power, do we have, scotty? END
START committed, we are committed. END
START probably like phasers, that thing would. power, it eats power. END
START we, use the power to destroy it, cannot. END
START aye, it could swallow that not. END
START on its way, it is, sir. END
START helmsman, when estimate arrival at nucleus do you? END
START how close are you it going to? END
START point blank range. implant it then back away, we will. END
START why? range of, the probe has. END
START programming complete. for launch ready. END
START despite what spock said, still plenty sensitive, it is. END
START estimate we, out in six point thirty seven minutes, will be. END
START lieutenant, me spock's voice channel get. highest possible gain. END
START risk the ship further on my behalf, do not. END
START shut up, spock! rescuing you we are. END
START almost out. approaching the membrane, we are, sir. END
START just written our epitaph, you may have, mister scott. END
START how i know not, sir, but still with us, it is. END
START spock, alive, you are! END
START be so smart, do not, spock. you botched the acetylcholine test. END
START spock, mccoy, beaming down, we are. standard equipment. END
START of industrialisation the beginnings. END
START so going down to recontaminate them, we are. END
START argue about it let us not. go study it, let us. energise. END
START like coming home, this is. END
START sir, you mind explaining that statement would, please? END
START weapon, that is. with that be careful. END
START well, those firearms are necessary not. END
START to make trouble you trying? END
START give me those baby blue eyes, do not. END
START i go not for that innocent routine. END
START my life i never heard such stupid questions in. END
START krako's getting more gall all the time. END
START this how you greet all your guests is? END
START sir, there are several questions, like to ask, would i. END
START ask the boss. nothing i know not. get moving. END
START this is the contamination, looking for, you are, jim. END
START no, thank you. mister oxmyx, you are. END
START me, that is, pal. END
START my first officer, this is, mister spock, doctor mccoy. END
START yes. judging from what, seen so far, have we, i agree. END
START the government here, you are? END
START but other bosses, there are, other territories? END
START how know you about krako? END
START us, he hit us, boss. END
START take care of it, will i. END
START hey, wait a minute. the book, that is. END
START i know, a book, is it. END
START the book. it, they left it, the other ship. the horizon. END
START you said, imitative, were they, and the book. END
START i want not any more cracks about the book. END
START leave any other books did they? END
START what you want is it? END
START mister oxmyx, quite explicit, my orders are. under no circum. END
START see how this thing works, let us. END
START of the question out. END
START hold it. communication device, it is. END
START how work does it? END
START locked onto my ship's systems, it is. END
START the bible, is it. END
START yeah, well, the worst gangster of all, oxmyx is. END
START oh, yes, yes. waste my time i would not. END
START yes. turned up, the second card is, except on tuesdays. END
START if dark on tuesday, it were. END
START never computed them, i have, captain. END
START get it, i will. END
START surely, coming, you are, captain. END
START i will, but bringing bela oxmyx with me i am. END
START jim, you cannot. END
START hold it! okay, pally, going for a ride, are we. END
START if you not mind, rather walk, would i. END
START beginning to get the idea i am. END
START mister spock, what doing on this frequency are you? END
START so the fed, you are, huh? well, well, well, well, well. END
START you make a deal want to. END
START right, that is, deal. to help me i want you. END
START sorry, i am sorry, krako. no deal. END
START too bad, that is. put him on ice! END
START you mean, giving up, you are? END
START mister spock, making contact from the surface, mister oxmyx is. END
START on audio, lieutenant. mister oxmyx, mister spock, this is. END
START irrelevant, since here, we are here. END
START he put a bag on our captain, why would? END
START show no further hostility, you will? END
START businessman, am i, pally. what you say? END
START since our captain back, we must have, i accept. END
START you mean, going to trust him, you are? END
START now, beginning to make sense, you are. END
START to do you know what. END
START mister oxmyx, i understood we had an arrangement, truce. END
START think that, i was hoping you would, dummy. END
START trying to help you, are we, oxmyx. END
START sir, employing a double negative, you are. END
START yeah, but to be the unity, i got. END
START we did, captain. our return the situation required. END
START illogical would to deny the facts be, doctor. END
START then you mind not if i play a hunch? END
START what are we do now going to, jim? END
START to be it ought. it cost a bundle. END
START fliwer, captain. END
START that bad, it was? END
START like the trusting type they look not. END
START your pardon i beg? END
START going to hit somebody, you are. can i watch? END
START them ears, you where'd get? END
START young man, likely to be quite hazardous, this is. END
START hold on, spock. of the mouths of babes out. END
START you callin' a babe who? END
START calling you a babe, i am. END
START for me what's in it? END
START what you want? END
START of the action a piece. END
START know what to do, you will. END
START it, that is. go, let us. END
START what's the matter? hurt yourself did you, kid? END
START my daddy i want! END
START daddy! my daddy i want! END
START my daddy i want. END
START of the action a piece. END
START see, no one can. your phaser on stun put. END
START got it reversed, i think you have, mister krako. END
START i ain't, pally. your heaters put down. END
START mister krako, not, i do not, er. END
START you trust all your men can? END
START miniscule. very small piece. END
START that, how much is? END
START that is, er. figure it out later, we will. END
START you guys had laws i thought. no interference. END
START who's interfering? taking over, we are. check? END
START your cut what's? END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START all right, scotty. with krako we made a deal. END
START do you think, wise, that is, sir? END
START aye. indeed, i know indeed. END
START rights, i got rights. END
START faster than walking, is it. END
START but as safe not. END
START afraid of cars are you? END
START not at all, captain. your driving that alarms me, it is. END
START spock, got the hang of it i have. now go on. END
START they, where are? END
START knowing krako, probably send them back on a blotter, he will. END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START krako on ice, you got? END
START of the phone find the man at the other end. END
START i sure know not what you think you are talking about. END
START with it get. giving the orders here, am i. END
START advise you to keep dialing, would i, oxmyx. END
START and your percentage what's? END
START listen. ship, they got. i know. there, i was there. END
START what, of boys a couple? END
START going to believe my eyes i am not. END
START over four hundred guys there, there are. END
START your story, that is, buster. END
START put you down, my boys will. END
START i already seen it. nothing, you are, fed. END
START well, all right. go ahead. get smart, do not. END
START hello, scotty. kirk, this is. END
START gee, some trick, that is. END
START hey, see that did you? END
START talking about a percentage, he was. END
START talking about both, was i. END
START reasonable, it is reasonable. reasonable, it sounds reasonable. to you that sound reasonable? END
START but in all the confusion i. END
START it in bela's office i think i left. END
START somewhere. i am certain not. END
START you are certain of what not? END
START my communicator i left. END
START you really think, that serious, is it? END
START how you mean? END
START lieutenant uhura, go, let us. END
START transporter malfunction, must it be. END
START rough trip, that was. END
START this is the craziest landing pad, ever seen, have i. END
START trinary sun, that is. END
START to bridge scott. END
START reversed controls have you? END
START of you hurt either? END
START i think not so, captain. END
START there, captain. now, prepared for your training, you are. END
START how know you our names? END
START expecting you, the providers were, captain. your transportation they arranged. END
START of yours these providers, are they. END
START correction, captain. ours the providers are not. theirs, we are theirs. END
START what they want from us? END
START no, doctor. show up on our sensors, even that would. END
START where then are they? END
START your quarters, these are. open, thralls. END
START they are within the confines of this solar system not. END
START the odds are good not. END
START no. say approximately four hundred, i would. END
START your drill thrall i am. called lars i am. END
START what want you from her? END
START it is allowed to refuse selection not. END
START interesting. to be an ionisation trail it seems. END
START account for that, what would, spock? END
START you, been selected for me, you have? END
START very kind of you, that is, miss, but. END
START nourishment, it is nourishment. it that we call. END
START nourishment. very practical that is. what call you this collar? END
START only to warn and punish, is it. END
START how work it does he? END
START it is permitted to talk of that not. END
START you provide all my nourishment, will? END
START that mean, what does? END
START it means, a very beautiful woman, you are. END
START beautiful, what is? END
START born? been here always, i have. END
START your parents. they, where are? your mother and father. END
START killed in a freestyle match, she who bore me was. END
START learn all these things, you will. END
START ridiculous, this is. nothing out there, there is. nothing at all. END
START to be heading into an empty sector we certainly seem. END
START that, two dozen light years away, must be. END
START allowed to refuse a training exercise it is not. END
START do it, none of us will, galt. END
START part of your training, it is. the providers wish it. END
START with the providers the devil. END
START pretty fast with that whip, he is. END
START free people, we are. to no one we belong. END
START always possible to miss something, is it. END
START as a failure in the transporter mechanism such? END
START no, sir. no sign of failure, there was. END
START the way that is. END
START their voices sound mechanical. computers are they? END
START seen them, you have. bodies, do they have? END
START as ours not such. END
START this place, what is? END
START it is used not. END
START bodies, they do have, or did have. END
START one talks of such things not. END
START very pretty country. much like my home planet very, earth. END
START looked at them, i have. END

START no, off the record this is not. END
START and they said you then. END
START the picture, get i, scotty. END
START no, not, i did not. to avoid trouble you told us. END
START it they said that started the fight, what was? END
START i see. and that is when you hit the klingons? END
START well, sir, matter of pride, this was. END
START something disquieting about these creatures, there is. END
START tell me you have got a feeling, do not. END
START that, what is, doctor? END
START them better than i like you i like. END
START one redeeming characteristic, they do have. END
START i know, but really. END
START of course. what say did you? END
START serious charge, that is. to whom referring are you? END
START cyrano jones, klingon agent? END
START you, i heard you. END
START he simply could believe his ears not. END
START what evidence do, against mister jones, you have? END
START yes, yes. go on. what else have do you? END
START but after my grain, is he! END
START any proof of that, you have? END
START deny he is disrupted this station, you cannot. END
START of the air vents probably through one. END
START plenty, if happened, what i think's happened has. END
START yes, sir. get in, nothing could. END
START it is working not, sir. to be stuck it seems. END
START here. me try it let. END
START to be gorged they seem. END
START of thousands hundreds. END
START assuming they got here three days ago, that is. END
START he tells me now. END
START dead, captain this tribble is. and these, so are. END
START really, captain kirk, protest this treatment, i must. END
START ah, mister jones, with an armful. few questions. END
START what you want? END
START can, those things out of here, you get? END
START in the bar, what was? END
START very perceptive creatures, obviously tribbles are, captain. END
START oh, yes. poisoned, it was poisoned. END
START essentially it that is. END
START mister darvin, are you talk going to? END
START and with it, the tribbles had nothing to do? END
START you know, i think, learn to like tribbles, could i. END
START well, captain, free to go now i i suppose am. END
START twenty years in a rehabilitation colony, the penalty is. END
START one thing you can do, there is. END
START take years, it would. END
START it job security consider. END
START captain, hard man, you are. all right! all right! END
START do it, you will? END
START do it, he will. END
START do it i will. END
START captain, able to divert that freighter, starfleet was. END
START and you will find a tribble on this entire ship not. END
START bones, how do it did you? END
START scotty! the tribbles, where are? END
START oh, er, captain, really mister spock's recommendation, it was. END
START well, mister scott who performed the actual engineering, was it. END
START mister scott. the tribbles, where are? END
START they, where are? END
START to the klingons i gave them, sir. END
START captain, i think, going to like argelius, am i. END
START of good taste obviously a man. END
START like her do you, scotty? END
START aye. i why should not? END
START scotty, scotty. they use the lights in argelius. END
START of our pillows have one? END
START never a word, but dying to learn, i am. END
START or handsome gentleman. we why not? END
START physically, all right, is he. am i right in assuming that? END
START he seems, overcoming his resentment, is he. END
START oh yes. i know the place. go, let us. END
START dead, she is dead, jim. END
START stabbed, dozen times. END
START just as shocked as you are, we are, mister hengist. END
START native of argelius you are not, sir? END
START i, i not remember. END
START really, sir. hardly helpful that is. END
START scotty, got to remember, you have. END
START by any chance that scotty you think not. END
START it makes not any difference what i think. END
START but you just not throw him to the wolves. END
START but suffering from a severe concussion, he is. END
START do what we can, we will. END
START love, the law of argelius is. END
START and my wife, this is, sybo. END
START of this you know? END
START to enterprise kirk. END
START as ordered lieutenant karen tracy reporting, captain. END
START if just follow me, you will, lieutenant. END
START of course, another possibility, there is. END
START ready are you, sybo? END
START ready, i am ready. may, the knife, have i, please? END
START but it here i put when we arrived. gone, it is gone. END
START dead, she is dead, jim. like the other one just. END
START over and over again stabbed. END
START lieutenant? captain? where is. END
START dead? but i. END
START be, it could be, jim. that head injury. END
START picked, locks can be, jim. END
START they been during the past few minutes where've? END
START captain, if please you mind not. END
START been another murder, there is, hengist. of my crew one. END
START as kara the same. END
START please, i know nothing about it. i did kill anyone not. END
START well, the girl killed, how was? END
START stabbed. and no sign of the weapon there is. END
START if facilities i only had. END
START this true is? you, who are? END
START know kara did you? END
START very disquieting that is. END
START often been a motive for murder, jealousy has. END
START prefect, kill anyone i did not. not, i could not. END
START see, we shall see, morla. END
START you prove you went directly home can? END
START captain, with the questions please may i continue? END
START with it well get on, man. there just stand not. END
START ready, i am ready, jaris. END
START what you suggest, mister spock? END
START normally, no, but his head could that blow on. END
START unproven, that is, sir. END
START prove it, we can, if insane, he is insane. END
START gentlemen, please. any man do such monstrous things, how could? END
START what we hope to find out, that is, sir. END
START you, sir, to remember nothing about the murders claim. END
START remain, no doubt will. END
START mister scott, you take the stand, will? END
START to account for periods of functional amnesia sufficient abnormalities? END
START captain, how that can be i see not. END
START of memory unless scotty's lying about his loss. END
START all right, scotty, have it let us. END
START no, captain. sure of, i that am. END
START scotty, to me lie. you, how old are? END
START two other women murdered, there were. END
START mister scott. kill kara did you? END
START remember i not. END
START kill lieutenant tracy did you? END
START i not remember. END
START waste of time, this is. END
START to the entire procedure i object. END
START prefect, you mean well i know, but had experience, have i. END
START you at the time that kara was murdered, where were? END
START i am sure not. walking home, i assume. angry, i was angry. END
START kill lieutenant tracy did you? END
START kill sybo did you? END
START documented fact, sensitivity of certain argelian women is, captain. END
START she said something else, make sense words that did not. END
START computer, linguistic bank. of following word definition. redjac. END
START no such word in the linguistics bank, there is? END
START working. affirmative. proper name. END
START ridiculous, that is. of years ago he lived hundreds. END
START survive all these centuries a man could not. END
START it feeds on death sybo said. END
START computer, of such entity extrapolate most likely composition. END
START affirmative. precedent, mellitus, of alpha majoris one cloud creature. END
START seems likely not, does it? END
START captain, aligned directly between argelius and earth, those places are. END
START from rigel four, you come. END
START well, many people do. crime it is not. END
START not, i will not. END
START and unaccounted for, you were when lieutenant tracy was murdered. END
START computer. of exhibit a report on analysis. END
START specify. of origin point. END
START now then, mister hengist. END
START dead, he is dead, jim. END
START but impossible, that is. END
START no use, is it, captain. blocked, the bypass circuits are. END
START prove very interesting, that should. END
START turning back we are. warp five, helm. END
START warp five, sir. for capella four on course. END
START registered in this sector, the carolina is. END
START ignore it, lieutenant. as my order log it, my responsibility. END
START scotty, if turn out to be real, it should. END
START me with a rock my patient spattered. gone, she is gone. END
START go with you, i will. END
START to planet estimating? END
START drawing a line, to step over it daring us. END
START still closing. of flight the alien's directly in our line. END
START ready, phaser banks are, sir. END
START the earthmen make excellent game. surprised me, their cleverness has. END
START dead. as they slept i killed them. END
START if true, to them take us. END
START first, verify her story, will we. END
START this what your sworn word means is, klingon? END
START just one thing i want, there is. END
START get him, one of us must. END
START it there hold. your weapons drop. END
START you, we missed you, mister scott. END
START well, at any rate, prove interesting, this should. END
START understand it ourselves we actually not, mister scott. END
START doctor mccoy, nor does. END
START named leonard james akaar, the child was? END
START that vulcan salute go, how does? END
START with your presence vulcan honours us. to serve, we come. END
START doctor. my wife, my aides and she who is. END
START prefer another guide, i would, captain. END
START captain, my parents, ambassador sarek and his wife are. END
START with so little provocation humans smile. END
START changed the situation between my father and myself has not. END
START mister spock. moment, if you please. END
START mrs. sarek, understand i just not. END
START amanda. i am afraid you could pronounce the vulcan name not. END
START like a command it sounded more. END
START of course. vulcan, he is. his wife, am i. END
START and his son, spock is. END
START my best officer, spock is, and my friend. END
START both stubborn, they are. END
START human trait, captain? END
START no! you! how you vote, of vulcan sarek? END
START for reasons tellarites argue not. argue, they simply argue. END
START correct, you are, captain. quite logical. END
START met gav before have you, ambassador? END
START my last council session we debated during. ambassador. END
START sort of a fat teddy bear, is it. END
START teddy bear? END
START teddy bear. END
START answer a hail does she? END
START this quadrant except ours starfleet records no authorised vessel in. END
START to guess what she is care? END
START guess, captain? for my estimate i shall need more data. END
START also human, he is. END
START starfleet officer, he is. END
START approve of starfleet i thought you did not. END
START interesting. travelling at approximately warp ten, they were. END
START vulcan, speak to you, would i. END
START seem unavoidable, it does. END
START how vote you on the coridan admission? END
START well for you, that is. no mining interest, vulcan has. END
START been carrying coridan dilithium crystals, some of your ships have. END
START understood. payment for your slander will there be, sarek. END
START illogical, threats are. and usually expensive, payment is. END
START to captain kirk security. END
START he killed, how was? END
START broken, his neck was. by an expert. END
START who aboard, that knowledge, would have? END
START vulcans approve not of violence. END
START have done it you are saying he could not? END
START of me you want something, captain? END
START ambassador, the tellarite. been murdered, gav has. END
START yes. ambassador, you during the past hour, where were? END
START captain, you are accusing him not? END
START agree, i quite agree. END
START then you during the hour, where were? END
START very convenient excuse, that is, ambassador. END
START you help him can? END
START that yet either i know not. END
START sorry about your father, i am. END
START yes, adversely affect our mission, could it. END
START you worried about him are not? END
START one of theirs, i think it unlikely it is. END
START the intruder ship, it is, sir. END
START to mister spock's station for decode switch recorder, lieutenant. END
START possibly, captain. but decode this transmission, i cannot. END
START bones, he, how is? END
START why did you tell me not? END
START done could there was nothing you have. END
START ambassador, when these attacks, you did have? END
START no witnesses, there were? END
START doctor, propose surgery for the heart defect do you? END
START because of the vulcan heart of the construction. END
START other vulcans aboard, there are. END
START yes, say that is rare, i would. END
START be possible to filter out the human factors, it should. END
START indeed. estimate the odds, i would. END
START it, i see it, spock, but rigelian, that was. END
START very similar to vulcan, rigelian physiology is. END
START good enough similar is not. still experimental, it is. END
START but look promising, it does. END
START what drug, doctor? asleep, my husband is. what drug? END
START already pulled. perfectly healthy, you are, mister spock. END
START that got, what has. END
START seem the only answer, would it. END
START in the brig questioning the andorian prisoner, i will be. END
START turn command over to scotty, you can. END
START spock, turn command over to somebody else, you must. END
START duty? to your father, your duty is. END
START as important as your father's life, nothing is. END
START oh, to him go. now. please. END
START no, my head the one inside. i, how long have. END
START not good. if only operate, i could. END
START what's stopping you? all ready, i thought you were. END
START jim, if you stand, start to bleed again, you could. END
START captain, quite all right are you? END
START get out, spock. chekov, of the intruder what's the status? END
START to the bridge call mister scott. END
START captain, moving closer, the alien vessel is. END
START belay that order. stay here, will i. END
START security? to the brig security. search the prisoner immediately. END
START where do you think, going, you are? END
START see the captain, i must. END
START so your father's life is. END
START moving away. turning now. coming around again, he is. END
START as he passes fire, ensign. END
START clean miss, sir. END
START his weaponry report on, mister chekov. END
START coming around again, he is. END
START full spread missed, sir. moving too fast for us, they are. END
START off, the systems are. END
START sickbay systems put on priority, call engineering and have. END
START buckled, number four shield has, sir. END
START intended from the beginning, that was, captain. END
START andorian you are not. you, who are? END
START gone, number two shield is. END
START your own answers find, captain. long to live you have not. END
START what doing are you? END
START no. your phasers stand by, mister chekov. END
START looking us over. dead as far as he knows, we are. END
START baiting him, you are. trying to lure him in, you are. END
START he comes here. range decreasing. to sublight speed dropping close. END
START your fire hold, mister chekov. END
START to sickbay take him. END
START miscalculated, i seem to have. END
START quite through shaking the ship around are you? END
START spock, they, sarek how are? END
START all the luck, some doctors have. END
START captain, find the alien, i believe you will. END
START find he is an orion, i think you will, doctor. END
START but they gain by an attack on starfleet, what would? END
START had something else on your mind might you have. END
START no, but you anyway thank. END
START understand i not. END
START for your life saving. END
START emotional, she is not? END
START always been that way, she has. END
START indeed? why marry her did you? END
START at the time, to do it seemed the logical thing. END
START doctor, return to my station now, i will. END
START at your station, you are, mister spock. END
START doctor mccoy, enjoying all this, i believe you are. END
START indeed, captain. never seen him look so happy, i have. END
START she, how is, doc? END
START to the starfleet small thanks. END
START now really, commissioner, blame the starfleet you cannot. END
START received the proper inoculations ahead of time, i should have. END
START you check your automatic scanner, will, please? END
START odd, that is. never seen anything like that before, i have. END
START i, nor have. END
START with us staying right. sensor readings, mister spock. END
START got it we have. END
START helm answers not, captain. END
START what's happening? to know i demand. END
START i insist, your scheduled rendezvous with the enterprise, you make. END
START to stay inside just how long am i supposed, captain? END
START reason must there be. END
START look a little further, let us. END
START bones, get a physiological reading on that, it is whatever. END
START real enough, we are. END
START vulcan, you are, are you not? END
START human, he is human, jim. everything checks out perfectly. END
START well, know anything about that i would not. END
START you mind not if we continue to try? END
START go right ahead. got plenty of time, you have. END
START what about you, cochrane? how get here did you? END
START to notice i needed one how perceptive of you. END
START talks a lot, but he says much not. END
START noticed something else, have i. END
START familiar, he looks familiar. END
START familiar? you mention it now that, he does. END
START quite place him, i cannot, but. what about miss hedford? END
START you keep it so terribly hot in here must? END
START feel hot do you? END
START infuriated, i feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged. END
START rest later, i will, doctor. END
START yes, i know. it means, running out of time, are we. END
START that, what was? END
START nothing to explain there is. END
START all right. the companion, was it. END
START injured, you were? END
START dying, i was dying, mister spock. END
START you seem perfectly all right now. the matter, what was? END
START an old man, i was. END
START what, you were? END
START pretty far out story, that is. END
START mister cochrane, first name, you have? END
START right, that is, captain. END
START is your story a little improbable not, mister cochrane? END
START true, never found, his body was. END
START looking at it, you are, mister spock. END
START how you feel? END
START terrible. i feel, how should? END
START running a little temperature, you are. lie down, perhaps you should. END
START we have, how long do? END
START of hours a matter, all that is. END
START i have aged not. to that the companion sees. END
START know, i already know. END
START mind telling us you would not? END
START you will like it not. END
START i already like not it. END
START here to keep me company, you are. END
START you brought us here you mean? END
START begin to age again, i would, normally. END
START do you leave here want to? END
START got it, you have. END
START i said, very powerful, was it. END
START it cure her could? END
START know i not. END
START how communicate you with it? END
START how do you it? END
START of clear my mind and it comes i just sort. END
START bones, what make you of that? END
START of some kind almost a symbiosis, of joining a sort. END
START no, more than that, it is. END
START agreed. like love more. END
START all right are you? END
START do anything to help miss hedford the companion cannot. END
START then die, she will die. END
START spock! all right are you? END
START you, it attacked you? END
START you, it troubles you, cochrane? END
START also keeping you prisoner, it is. END
START i want not it killed. END
START it powerless we may simply render. END
START of view i suppose from your point, right, you are. END
START all right. to contact it you want me? END
START it ours nor. END
START that, what kind of talk is? END
START your fault it is not. END
START for use with more congruent life forms, the translator is. END
START of residual matter floating around there'd still be traces, lieutenant. END
START as she goes steady, mister sulu. END
START what think you it means, mister scott? END
START this course we stay on, see what comes up. END
START big galaxy, it is, mister scott. END
START this device what's the theory behind? END
START yes. change the entire situation, the matter of gender could. END
START way ahead of you, i am. END
START then zookeeper it is not. END
START but i heard. END
START understand i not. END
START what, i am? END
START what complaining about are you? you alive it kept. END
START that thing fed on me. me, it used me. disgusting, it is disgusting. END
START as bad as it is, you are. END
START fascinating. totally parochial attitude. END
START him, i heard him. loved and he resents it, he was. END
START companion, love the man do you? END
START understand i not. END
START part of me, he is. continue, the man must. END
START he ages not. forever, he remains forever. END
START understand i not. END
START what hope to gain by that did you, jim? END
START useless, it is useless. i know. END
START take some explaining that'll, bones. END
START too late. of this all, just an illusion. END
START no illusion. dead, jackson is. to enterprise kirk. come in. END
START to beam up five. END
START you pinpoint it any closer can, lieutenant? END
START sir, picking up a ship's disaster beacon, am i. END
START to raise it try, lieutenant. END
START no answer, captain. all, is the automatic beacon, get i. END
START sensors recording normal energy output not. END
START the constellation, is it. look at that. END
START red alert. red alert. your battle stations man. END
START going to board her we are. mister spock, in command, you are. END
START out, filtration systems are, sir. END
START what think you did it, sir? END

START captain, our report, washburn has. END
START what look like does it? END
START both or neither. i not know. END
START to raise starfleet command due to heavy subspace interference unable. END
START robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. why? END
START we not know. an alien race, apparently from another galaxy. END
START bones, ever hear of a doomsday machine did you? END
START no. doctor, i am, not a mechanic. END
START oh, no, here, i stay here. leaving my ship i am not! END
START closing on us, is it, mister spock. END
START to beam ready, sir. END
START mister spock, communication's damaged. unable to override interference, we are. END
START i, repair warp drive without a spacedock, cannot. END
START no casualties, mister spock. we doing, how are? END
START outrun it we have, doctor. END
START carry out my last order, you will, mister sulu. END

START let him do this you cannot, spock. END
START doctor, out of line, you are. END
START certify that right now, will i. END
START then be considered valid your statement would not. END
START what about the captain? leave, we cannot leave. END
START captain, fused solid, the impulse engines' control circuits are. END
START helmsman, your course hold. stand by all phaser banks. END
START to give it a try ready? END
START scotty, you doing how? END
START it now try, captain. END
START washburn, to engineering get down. assist mister scott. END
START but you understand, do not? got to destroy it, we have! END
START break loose, we cannot! END
START we have got it not. being pulled inside we are. END
START scotty, me that power give. END
START it that is, mister scott. keep that power coming. END
START aye, sir. move we still cannot. END
START it on keep pouring, scotty. END
START captain, what we are doing i still know not. END
START phasers? got 'em, you have. one bank recharged i have. END

START gaining on us, is it, sir. END
START mister spock, relieve commodore decker immediately. direct order, that is. END
START commodore decker, relieved of command, you are. END
START your authority to relieve me i recognise not. END
START captain, assumed command, i have. END
START accompany the commodore to sickbay, you will. END
START fine. of it just make sure you stay ahead. END
START it going keep, scotty, it going keep. mister spock. END
START too late, is it, sir. END
START to enterprise kirk. why launching a shuttlecraft are you? END

START mister spock, now operational, the transporter is. END

START little to be gained by staying aboard the constellation, there is. END
START insufficient data. to take further sensor readings i shall try. END
START spock, know you not? END
START captain, getting dangerously close to the planet killer, you are. END
START jim, killed will you be, like decker just. END
START calculated risk, mister spock. END
START very slim timing, thirty seconds is. END

START of eden more like the garden, ensign. END
START what did somebody say? like this that paradise must've looked? END

START to see what they find so amusing i fail. END
START nothing makes sense down here. to enterprise kirk. END

START that is the way not. END
START my view in, of reciprocity a splendid example. END

START cutting it a bit fine, that is, scotty. END
START yeoman, wasting energy, you are. END
START captain, trapped, we are trapped, END
START sit down, and to eat have something. END
START up there, the enterprise is. END

START no, mister spock! i tried. tried, i really tried. END
START to your error due, mister kyle? END
START captain, all this, what is? END
START how did we get in these. END
START i not know. our enterprise but it is not, it is. maybe. END
START when materialised, we first materialised. END
START another captain kirk, another doctor mccoy, another. END

START mister chekov, for planetary target a phaser setting. END

START the nature of the research, what is? END
START classified under voice index log, programme is. END
START why monitoring my communications are you, mister sulu? END

START get home we will. take long this will not. END
START this, what is, mister sulu? END
START captain, barely got ten minutes, we have. END
START go, let us, bones. END
START it, i guarantee it. now, go on, please. END

START but only three of you, there are. END
START if you kill us, still stay, you will. END
START mccoy where is? time, scotty. END
START do you know what, do to me, will they? END
START the power's cut, sir. on to us, are they. END

START to your setup can you bridge? END
START have to stay, one of us will. END

START me sickbay show. END
START show you, doctor mccoy will. END
START told you that without looking could i have. END
START the lot of you staring at me for, what are? END
START all right, it is. END
START to lieutenant uhura that thing did something! END
START scotty, being taken care of, is she. all right, is it. END
START what do to me did it? END
START explain it to you, doctor mccoy will. END
START nurse, for a full physical examination i want him prepared. END
START you restored scott. much more extensive damage, he had. END
START to wait elsewhere does the creator wish nomad? END
START laugh that is. END
START the study of of great use would it be, captain. END
START also one of your biological units, mister spock is, creator? END
START your instructions follow, nomad. END
START down, my screens are. END
START it out sound. END
START she doing how's? END
START with that thing get into direct mental contact? END
START to uhura you saw what it did. END
START permit it i will, creator. END
START what mean does it, nomad, we are nomad? END
START then it is nomad not? END
START your pardon i beg? END
START how doing that are you? END
START your dampers throw. END
START your circuits cut, of them all. END
START impossible. go that fast, it cannot. END
START stop it just will not, mister scott. warp eleven! END
START nomad, stop what, doing, you are. scotty? END

START mister scott, her there give sulu warp two and keep. END
START of my you killed two. END
START creator, inefficient, your biological units are. END
START programmed to investigate, am i. END
START foolish mistake, was it. END
START i believe not there is much beyond nomad's capabilities. END
START find the earth infested with imperfect biological units, will it. END
START and carry out its prime directive, it will. sterilise. END
START all right is she? END
START so, i think so. of shock looks like some kind. END

START your prime function exercise. END
START my congratulations, captain. of logic a dazzling display. END
START lieutenant, this morning you look a bit tired. END
START even from here, tell his pulse rate's up, can i. END
START sure i like that i am not, jim. END
START actually, losing an officer, am i. END
START it, what is, mister spock? hand is it? END
START trick, then? projection? END
START not a projection, sir. of energy a field. END
START hard about. seem to get away from it we cannot. END
START almost as if it means to grab us, it is. END
START dead still, we are, captain. helm answers not. move, we cannot move. END
START lieutenant, to starbase twelve immediately relay our position and circumstances. END
START applying thrust, sir. no results, captain. stuck tight, we are. END
START captain, most curious development on scanner five seven. END
START all take a look at it, let us, mister spock. END
START responsible for stopping the ship are you? END
START it back give, then talk, we will talk. END
START all right! whatever, doing, you are, it off turn! you win! END
START gone, pressure is, captain. space normal on hull. END
START go, let us, bones. you in good voice? END
START sure, wise, is it, jim? END
START verbose, is he not? END
START present, insults are effective only where emotion is. END
START going to need help in all those areas, we are. END
START of earth you know? been there, you have? END
START and the tsar of all the russias, am i. END
START sorry, i am sorry, captain. i never met a god before. END
START and you have yet not. readings, doctor. END
START so simple evidently not. END
START leave this place you will not. END
START i will permit that device to work not, either, captain. END
START what you want is it? END
START worship me, you will, as your fathers did before you. END
START worship me, i said you would. END
START and got a lot to learn, you have! END
START to break through it try, lieutenant. END
START analysis. lieutenant palamas, what know you about apollo? END
START he is whatever, to control a remarkable technology he seems. END
START bones, i wonder if five thousand years ago. END

START an idea, i have. really apollo, what if he is? END
START your name i mean. END
START her alone leave. END
START and you, so do. END
START grown weary of discussion and argument i have. END
START captain, the phasers. fused, all the working parts are. END
START oh, beautiful, it is beautiful. END
START going with you she is not. END
START all right, is it, captain. go, i will go. END
START without fear. fit indeed, is she. END
START bones, he, how is? END
START have been rather difficult to stop, he would. END
START mister chekov, i think, better continue your investigation, you would. END
START how you feel, scotty? END
START seem so, it would. END
START able, i am able, sir. END
START scotty believes not in gods. END
START to reverse polarity ready, mister sulu? END
START to generate computed and standing by, sir. END
START working, i am working, sir, but do anything with this i cannot. END
START just picked up readings for our own people, have i, sir. END
START seem to pinpoint it i cannot. END
START oh, lovely, it is lovely. END
START god, you really think you are? END
START but die you said the others did not. END
START i not understand. END
START this boy spock's contaminating, jim. END

START like the cat in that russian story he disappeared again. END
START you mean the english story, do not, the cheshire cat? END
START cheshire? no, sir. minsk perhaps, but. END
START how you feel? END
START get my arm to move i cannot. END
START got to get out of here, we have. END
START i still say, get us killed, can it. END
START essential, speed is, lieutenant. END
START go! gather laurel leaves? joking, you must be! END

START lieutenant. your orders and your duty, you have. END
START yes, sir. my duty my orders and. END
START of some sort near you is there a structure? END
START indeed there is, mister spock. END
START very good. how doing on the force field are you? END
START captain. recommend a discreet distance, i would. END

START yes, i know. i know. scotty. wait, we will wait. END
START apollo, i am apollo. chosen you, have i. END

START captain, got to go and find her, have we! END
START got to be here, have we when he comes back. END
START but not, what if he does. what if he. END
START fire those phasers! an order, that is, mister spock! END
START to the shields more power. END
START had to do this i wish we had not. END
START spock, it is spock. noticed anything strange about him have you? END
START no, nothing in particular. why? END
