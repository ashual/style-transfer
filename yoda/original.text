(Noel hides as guards search for her, and when they go she pulls down the master high voltage switch. A guard grabs her)

[Treatment room]
MCCOY: It looks right.
SPOCK: The nitrogen cycle, it has to be.
MCCOY: But the question is, what's the dosage?
SPOCK: That is a very good question.
KIRK: Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice?
MIRI: What's the matter with you? How should I know?
KIRK: Where is she? Has something happened to her?
MIRI: Don't you feel all right?
KIRK: No, I don't feel all right! None of us feel all right! Can't you see what's going on?
MIRI: Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you.
KIRK: I've got to find Janice.
SPOCK: That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators.
KIRK: We're trying, Mister Spock. We're trying very hard.
MCCOY: That's not good enough! This could be it, but we can't test it without the ship's computers.
SPOCK: We've got to have those communicators, Jim.
KIRK: This is the vaccine?
MCCOY: That's what the computers will tell us.
SPOCK: Without them, it could be a beaker full of death.
KIRK: Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left.
MIRI: I don't care.
KIRK: You've got to care. Miri, I'm going to tell you something. You, your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we succeed in what we're doing. You've seen your friends get it.
MIRI: Sometimes it happens.
KIRK: Not sometimes. All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing up the way you are. Don't you know why you don't like to play games anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to? It's because you're becoming a young woman, and the moment you become a young woman, you get the disease. All of you.
MIRI: That's not true. It just happens sometimes.
KIRK: All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it. Look at it, Miri, it's in you!
MIRI: No! No! No!

[Bridge]
SPOCK: Check the circuit.
TYLER: All operating, sir.
SPOCK: It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way.
TYLER: It could be these meteorites.
ONE: No, it's something else. There's still something out there.
TYLER: It's coming at the speed of light, collision course. The meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain.
ONE: Evasive manoeuvres, sir?
PIKE: Steady as we go.
GARISON: It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style distress signal.
PIKE: They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way.
GARISON: A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No other message.
TYLER: I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group.
ONE: We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.
SPOCK: Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia. It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
TYLER: It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to here.
SPOCK: Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere.
ONE: Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years.
PIKE: If they survived the crash.
SPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain?
PIKE: Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the helm. Maintain present course.
ONE: Yes, sir.

[Pike's quarters]

BOYCE [OC}: Boyce here.
PIKE: Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I didn't say there's anything wrong with me.
BOYCE: I understand we picked up a distress signal.
PIKE: That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to log the ship's doctor's opinion, too.
BOYCE: Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.
PIKE: Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also. What the devil are you putting in there, ice?
BOYCE: Who wants a warm martini?
PIKE: What makes you think I need one?
BOYCE: Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell his doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel Seven?
PIKE: Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven injured.
BOYCE: Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?
PIKE: Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors.
BOYCE: Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now you're tired and you
PIKE: You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil.
BOYCE: To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?
PIKE: To the point of considering resigning.
BOYCE: And do what?
PIKE: Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles of parkland around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we used to take some food and ride out all day.
BOYCE: Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.
PIKE: I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on Regulus or on the Orion colony.
BOYCE: You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?
PIKE: The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole galaxy of things to choose from.
BOYCE: Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away.
PIKE: Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.
BOYCE: Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers. The living and the dying.
SPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.

[Bridge]

GARISON: (reads) Eleven survivors from crash. Gravity and oxygen within limits. Food and water obtainable, but unless. The message faded at that point, sir.
PIKE: Address intercraft.
TYLER: System open.
PIKE: This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group. Our time warp, factor seven.
TYLER: Course computed and on the screen.
ONE: All decks have acknowledged, sir.
PIKE : Engage.
TYLER: On course, sir.
(Colt enters. Pike turns around and bumps into her)
PIKE: Yeoman.
COLT: Yes, sir.
PIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge
COLT: But you wanted the reports by oh five hundred. It's oh five hundred now, sir.
PIKE: Oh, I see. Thank you.
ONE: She's replacing your former yeoman, sir.
PIKE: She does a good job, all right. It's just that I can't get used to having a woman on the bridge. No offence, Lieutenant. You're different, of course.
(The Enterprise arrives at a planet)
TYLER: We've settled into orbit, sir.
GEOLOGIST: Geological lab report complete, Captain.
SPOCK: Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.
PIKE: Spectography?
GEOLOGIST: Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy with inert elements but well within safety limits.
PIKE: Gravity?
GEOLOGIST: Zero point nine of Earth.
TYLER: Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read it, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a spaceship hull.
PIKE: Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it?
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
TYLER: Yes, sir.
PIKE: Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us.
ONE: Of course, sir.

[Transporter room]

PIKE: There's no indication of problems down there, but let's not take chances.
PITCAIRN: Yes, sir. There's a canyon to the left. We can set you there completely unobserved.

[Planet surface]

(the group explores until they find a rough settlement)
GARISON: Sir.
OLD MAN: They're men. They're humans.
PIKE: Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise.
HASKINS: Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute.
SURVIVOR: Is Earth all right?
PIKE: The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon.
TYLER: And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time barrier's been broken. Our new ships can
(He's struck dumb by the sight of a lovely young woman)
HASKINS: This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we crashed.
(The reunion is being watched on another screen, by three people with big bald heads)
PIKE: (as the survivors pack up the settlement) Enterprise.
ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.
PIKE: We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to you very shortly.
ONE [OC]: Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to send out scouting and scientific parties now?
PIKE: That's affirmative on the
VINA: You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain. A prime specimen.
ONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain.
PIKE: Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out.
HASKINS: You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her whole life with a collection of aging scientists.
BOYCE: If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical report.
VINA: I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
BOYCE: Their health is excellent. Almost too good.
HASKINS: There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt if Earth is ready to learn the secret. Let the girl show you. We'll accept your judgment.
(Pike follows Vina up a slope to a ledge by a rock face)
VINA: You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon. Don't you see it? Here and here.
PIKE: I don't understand.
VINA: You will. You're a perfect choice.
(Vina vanishes, and so do all the survivors and their encampment. A door opens in the rock face, Pike is knocked out and taken inside. At the settlement -)
TYLER: Captain!
(Everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing in the rock. They fire their phasers at it but it just blasts away the rock covering to show the metal underneath.)
SPOCK: Spock here.
ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.
SPOCK: There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?

[Pike's cage]

(Pike wakes to find himself in a cell with a transparent wall blocking his escape. He tests it's strength, and notices other similar occupied cells. There's a fanged ape, a giant bird and other scary shadows. The three aliens arrive)
PIKE: Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this galaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me?
(the aliens communicate with their minds, not voices)
TALOSIAN: It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited.
MAGISTRATE: This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so easily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a simple illusion we placed in their minds.
PIKE: You're not speaking, yet I can hear you.
MAGISTRATE: You will note the confusion as it reads our thought transmissions.
PIKE: All right then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read yours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an unfriendly act
MAGISTRATE: You now see the primitive fear threat reaction. The specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel, and so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess, the creature will throw himself against the transparency.
PIKE: If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it.
MAGISTRATE: Despite its frustration, the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the experiment.

[Briefing room]

SPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.
ONE: So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.
BOYCE: It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery, everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp, the tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the danger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds. They can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and experiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore.
ONE: Any estimate what they might want one of us for?
SPOCK: They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth people are put together. Or it could be something more.
TYLER: Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up against hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it. Enough to blast half a continent.
SPOCK: Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.
TYLER: It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help, and he probably needs it fast.
ONE: Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power. We'll try blasting through that metal.

[Talosian monitoring room]

(As Pike continues to explore his cell)
TALOSIAN: Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts, Magistrate. We find excellent memory capacity.
MAGISTRATE: I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it fought to protect its life. We will begin with this, giving the specimen something more interesting to protect.

[Rigel Seven]

VINA: Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come. Hurry. It's deserted. There'll be weapons and perhaps food.
PIKE: This is Rigel Seven.
VINA: Please, we must hide ourselves.
PIKE: I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be there.
VINA: Come on.
PIKE: They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere I've been.
VINA: The killer!
PIKE: It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago. Except for you.

[Fortress]

(The courtyard is scattered with lances and spears)
PIKE: Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the survivors called Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you again? Why didn't they create a different girl?
(The killer enters - a big humanoid with shield and axe)
VINA: Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.
PIKE: But it's only a dream.
VINA: You have to kill him as you did here before.
PIKE: You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an animal performing for its supper.
VINA: It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what matters. You'll feel every moment of whatever happens to you. Please, don't you know what he'll do to us?
(so Pike fights the killer with mace and shield)
PIKE: Why would an illusion be frightened?
VINA: Because that's the way you imagined me.
PIKE: Who are you? You act as if this were really you.
VINA: Careful.
(Pike and Vina retreat up some stairs. The killer breaks Pike's spear and they throw objects at it. Pike gets knocked down into the courtyard. The killer grabs Vina and Pike throws a spear into it's back. Then it jumps down and spears itself on a wicked harpoon that Pike grabs just in time)

[Pike's cell]

VINA: It's over.
(Vina hugs her hero, then sees the Talosians watching them. The Talosians leave.)
PIKE: Why are you here?
VINA: To please you.
PIKE: Are you real?
VINA: As real as you wish.
PIKE: No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never met you before, never even imagined you.
VINA: Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.
PIKE: What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?
VINA: I have to wear something, don't I? I can wear whatever you wish, be anything you wish.
PIKE: So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how I react, is that it?
VINA: Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly?
PIKE: Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too?
VINA: You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any woman you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the whole universe. Let me please you.
PIKE: Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way?
VINA: You're a fool.
PIKE: Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this conversation, is there.

[Planet surface]

(A big laser cannon is aimed at the door in the rock.
ONE: All circuits engaged, Mister Spock.
SPOCK [OC]: Standing by, Number One.
ONE: Take cover.
SPOCK [OC]: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
(The laser cannon blasts away)
ONE: Increase to full power! Can you give us any more?
SPOCK [OC]: Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease power.
ONE: Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the first second.
BOYCE: Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room. Their power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we do, anything we see.

[Pike's cell]

VINA: Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I could answer.
PIKE: How far can they control my mind?
VINA: If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let me live it with you?
PIKE: Perhaps.
VINA: They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.
PIKE: But they try to trick me with their illusions.
VINA: And, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll find out about that.
PIKE: Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go underground?
VINA: War, thousands of centuries ago.
PIKE: That's why it's so barren up there?
VINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again.
PIKE: So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and they concentrated on developing their mental power.
VINA: But they found it's a trap. Like a narcotic. Because when dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record.
PIKE: Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.
VINA: You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy.
PIKE: Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.
VINA: Please.
PIKE: They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to get the Earth woman?
VINA: You said that if I answered questions
PIKE: But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said you weren't real, remember?
VINA: I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We're like Adam and Eve. If we. Don't. Please don't punish me! (disappears)
(Pike sees the Magistrate walk away)
(Pike continues to search the walls for a door when a hatch opens and a glass is placed on the floor)
MAGISTRATE: The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.
PIKE: Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?
MAGISTRATE: If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear as any food you wish to visualise.
PIKE: And if I prefer
MAGISTRATE: To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment.
(Pike is surrounded by fire and brimstone, screaming in pain)
MAGISTRATE: From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now consume the nourishment.
PIKE: Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you can't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you?
MAGISTRATE: If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there are things even more unpleasant.
(Pike drinks the nourishment then launches himself at the glass wall. The Magistrate steps back in surprise)
PIKE: That's very interesting.
MAGISTRATE: Now to the female.
PIKE: You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?
MAGISTRATE: As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our planet, but with only a single survivor.
PIKE: No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck.
MAGISTRATE: We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species interesting.
PIKE: Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?
MAGISTRATE: It became necessary to attract a mate.
PIKE: All right, all right, let's talk about the girl. You seem to be going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel protective.
MAGISTRATE: This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.
PIKE: It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and like her.
MAGISTRATE: We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.
PIKE: Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human community.
MAGISTRATE: With the female now properly conditioned.
PIKE: You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not co-operating! Why don't you punish me?
MAGISTRATE: First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy. Excellent.

[Woodland glade]

(A picnic spread on a tartan rug, two horses standing by, a futuristic city in the distance)
VINA: You want some coffee, dear? I left the thermos hooked to my saddle.
PIKE: Tango! You old devil, you. I'm sorry I don't have any sugar. Well, they think of everything, don't they? (feeds lumps to the horse)
VINA: Hey, your coffee. Is it good to be home?
PIKE: They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want, if I co-operate, is that it?
VINA: Have you forgotten my headaches, darling? I get them when you talk strangely like this.
PIKE: Look, I'm sorry they punish you, but we can't let them
VINA: My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it?
PIKE: It's funny. It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the ship's doctor how much I wanted something else not very different from what we have here. An escape from reality. Life with no frustrations. No responsibilities. Now that I have it, I understand the doctor's answer.
VINA: I hope you're hungry. These little white sandwiches are your mother's recipe for chicken tuna.
PIKE: You either live life, bruises, skinned knees and all, or you turn your back on it and start dying. The doctor's going to be happy about one part, at least. He said I needed a rest.
VINA: This is a lovely place to rest.
PIKE: I used to ride through here when I was a kid. It's not as pretty as some of the parkland around the big cities, but. That's Mojave. That's where I was born.
VINA: Is that supposed to be news to your wife? You're home. You can even stay if you want. Wouldn't it be nice showing your children where you once played?
PIKE: These headaches, they'll be hereditary you know. Would you wish them on a child or a whole group of children?
VINA: Foolish.
PIKE: Is it? Look, first they made me protect you and then feel sympathy for you. Now we have these familiar surroundings and a comfortable husband-wife relationship. They don't need all this for just passion. What they're after is respect and mutual dependence.
VINA: They say in the olden days all this was a desert. Blowing sand and cactus.
PIKE: But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage!
VINA: No.
PIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now, you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't repair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us, to build a colony of slaves?
VINA: Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?
PIKE: Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our keeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate in your mind, does that block off our mind from them?
VINA: Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions. But you can't keep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you year after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I know you must hate me for that.
PIKE: Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like.
VINA: But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they picked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the same way.
PIKE: If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you.

[Talosian monitoring room]

PIKE [on monitor]: I was from the very first moment I saw you in the survivor's camp.
TALOSIAN: A curious species. They have fantasies they hide even from themselves.
VINA [on monitor]: I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for you. You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you, either. A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a ship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and proper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that.

[Open air party]

(A band plays, and a green woman dances sensuously)
OFFICER: Nice place you have here, Mister Pike.
(The dancer is -)
PIKE: Vina? ORION: Glistening green. Almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain might have.
OFFICER: Funny how they are on this planet. They actually like being taken advantage of. Suppose you had all of space to choose from, and this was only one small sample.
ORION: Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?
(Pike gets up and leaves. The door he walks through turns into a rock wall. Then Vina is there, holding a blazing torch)

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: We've located a magnetic field that seems to come from their underground generator.
GARISON: Could that be an illusion too?
ONE: Now, you all know the situation. We're hoping to transport down inside the Talosian community.
SPOCK: If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could find oneself materialised inside solid rock.
ONE: Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out.
(Pitcairn energises but only Number One and Yeoman Colt dematerialise)
SPOCK: The women!

[Pike's cage]

ONE: Captain! Captain.
VINA: No! Let me finish!
ONE: But we were a party of six.
COLT: We were the only ones transported.
VINA: It's not fair. You don't need them.
PIKE: (grabbing Colt's laser pistol) They don't work.
ONE: They were fully charged when we left. It's dead. (communicator) I can't make a signal. What is it?
PIKE: Don't say anything. I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating their huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black out everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate.
VINA: How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How can that help?
COLT: Leave him alone.
VINA: He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.
COLT: Picked her? For what? I don't understand.
VINA: Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.
COLT: Offspring, as in children?
ONE: Offspring as in he's Adam. Is that it?
VINA: You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with a computer.
ONE: Well, shall we do a little time computation? There was a Vina listed on that expedition as an adult crewman. Now, adding eighteen years to your age then.
(The Magistrate approaches the cell)
VINA: It's not fair. I did what you asked.
MAGISTRATE: Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a selection.
PIKE: I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood red like ours? I'm going to find out.
MAGISTRATE: Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour. The female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce highly intelligent children. Although she seems to lack emotion, this is largely a pretence. She has often has fantasies involving you.
PIKE: All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these thoughts? Images of hate, killing?
MAGISTRATE: The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but now is realising this has changed. The factors in her favour are youth and strength, plus unusually strong female drives.
PIKE: You'll find my thoughts more interesting. Thoughts so primitive you can't understand. Emotions so ugly (stricken by pain)
MAGISTRATE: Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as quickly rewarded. You will find it an effective combination.
(Magistrate leaves)
ONE: Captain.
PIKE: No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read through hate.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Address intercraft.
GARISON: Open, sir.
SPOCK: This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew. We're leaving. All decks prepare for hyperdrive. Time warp factor.
TYLER: Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead.
(The lights go out)
SPOCK: Engine room!
GARISON: Open.
SPOCK: Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out.
PITCAIRN [OC]: All systems are out, bridge. We've got nothing.
TYLER: There's nothing. Every system aboard is fading out.

[Pike's cell]

(The group are apparently dozing when the Magistrate opens the hatch to get the laser pistols Pike dropped there. He grabs him and pulls him into the cage, and starts to throttle him)
PIKE: Now you hold still, or I'll break your neck.
VINA: Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil.
PIKE: I've had some samples of how good they are.
(the Talosian appears to be a vicious monster)
PIKE: You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off. (it stops) All right, now you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and I'll break your neck.
MAGISTRATE: Your ship. Release me or we'll destroy it.

{Bridge]

(The senior officers have taken the navigation console apart)
SPOCK: Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.
TYLER: The computers!
(The monitor shows a montage of images - space capsules, the Moon, maps of Earth)
TYLER: I can't shut it off. It's running through our library. Tapes, micro-records, everything. It doesn't make sense.
SPOCK: Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the information stored in this fly. They've decided to swat us.

[Pike's cell]

VINA: He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion they can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your ship.
PIKE: I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason at all.
(Pike hands the Magistrate over to Number One and picks up the laser pistols, firing them at the glass wall. Then he puts one to the Magistrate's head)
PIKE: On the other hand, I've got a reason. I'm willing to bet you've created an illusion this laser is empty. I think it just blasted a hole in that window and you're keep us from seeing it. You want me to test my theory out on your head?
(There is a hole in the window)
COLT: Captain.
(They all leave through the hole and get into the elevator to the surface)

[Planet surface]

(The top of the rocky knoll is split apart)
PIKE: Make contact, Number One.
ONE: They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and never knew it. Captain.
(The communicator isn't working)
MAGISTRATE: As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing.
PIKE: I want to contact our ship.
MAGISTRATE: You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With the female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives.
PIKE: And start by burying you?
MAGISTRATE: That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's surface, our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life.
PIKE: Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives of these two Earth women.
MAGISTRATE: Since our lifespan is many times yours, we have time to evolve you into a society trained to serve as artisans, technicians
PIKE: Do you understand what I'm saying? You give me proof that our ship is all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina.
(Number One sets her laser pistol to overload)
ONE: It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves.
MAGISTRATE: Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves?
VINA: What is that?
PIKE: The weapon is building up an overload. A force chamber explosion. You still have time to get underground. Well, go on! (pushes Vina away) Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her.
VINA: If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go either. I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again.
(More Talosians arrive)
PIKE: Wait.
(Number One turns off the pistol)
TALOSIAN: Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much time. Are you prepared to assimilate it?
(The Magistrate nods, and the veins on his head throb)
MAGISTRATE: We had not believed this possible. The customs and history of your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant and benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and dangerous a species for our needs.
VINA: He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the ship.
PIKE: And that's it? No apologies? You captured one of us, threatened all of us.
TALOSIAN: Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to eventual death. Is this not sufficient?
MAGISTRATE: No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our last hope.
PIKE: But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual co-operation?
MAGISTRATE: Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself too.
ONE: Captain, we have transporter control now.
PIKE: Let's get back to the ship.
VINA: I can't. I can't go with you.

[Transporter room]

PITCAIRN: Sir, it just came on. We can't shut the power off.
SPOCK: Mister Spock here.
TYLER [OC]: All power has come on, Mister Spock. The helm is answering to control.
(The transporter platforms light up and first Colt, then Number One are beamed aboard)
GARISON: The captain?

[Planet surface]

(Vina changes into a scarred, misshapen older woman)
VINA: You see why I can't go with you.
MAGISTRATE: This is the female's true appearance.
VINA: They found me in the wreckage, dying. A lump of flesh. They rebuilt me. Everything works. But they had never seen a human. They had no guide for putting me back together.
MAGISTRATE: It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an honest one.
PIKE: You'll give her back her illusion of beauty?
MAGISTRATE: And more.
(Beautiful Vina and happy Pike go up the slope and into the elevator)
MAGISTRATE: She has an illusion and you have reality. May you find your way as pleasant.

[Transporter room]

PITCAIRN: Mister Spock, the system is coming on again.
(Pike is beamed aboard)
COLT: What's happened to Vina?
ONE: Isn't she coming with us?
PIKE: No. No, and I agreed with her reasons.

[Bridge]

(Pike, Number One and Spock enter)
BOYCE: Hold on a minute.
PIKE: Oh, I feel fine, just fine.
BOYCE: You look a hundred percent better.
PIKE: You recommended a rest, a change of pace, didn't you? I've even been home. Does that make you happy?
(He bumps into Colt again)
PIKE: Yeoman.
COLT: Yes, sir.
PIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge I
(She hands him a clip-board stuffed with papers for his signature)
PIKE: Oh. Oh yes. The reports. Thank you.
COLT: Sir, I was wondering. Just curious. Who would have been Eve?
ONE: Yeoman! You've delivered your report.
COLT: Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir.
TYLER: Eve, sir? Yes, sir.
BOYCE: Eve as in Adam?
PIKE: As in all ship's doctors are dirty old men. What are we running here, a cadet ship, Number One? Are we ready or not?
ONE: All decks show ready, sir.
PIKE: Engage.
[Planet surface outside building]

KIRK: Shall we pick some flowers, Doctor? When a man visits an old girlfriend she usually expects something like that.
MCCOY: Is that how you get girls to like you, by bribing them? There doesn't seem to be anybody around, does there.
KIRK: They'll be along. You rushed us down ten minutes early. (enter building)

[Crater's home]

KIRK: Professor Crater? Professor? Mrs. Crater? Nervous, Dr. McCoy?
MCCOY: Yeah, a little bit, I guess. You see, we walked out of each other's lives ten years ago. She married Crater, and for all I know she may have forgotten me completely. Of all the bonehead ideas, Jim, how'd I let myself in for things like this?
NANCY: (singing outside, then enters) Leonard!
MCCOY: Nancy.
NANCY: Hello.
MCCOY: It's good to see you.
NANCY: Let me look at you.
MCCOY: You haven't aged a day. Oh, this is Captain Jim Kirk of the Enterprise.
KIRK: (seeing an older woman than McCoy does) Mrs. Crater. I've heard a great deal about you.
NANCY: All good, I hope.
MCCOY: And Crewman Darnell.
DARNELL: (seeing a young blonde) How do you do, ma'am?
KIRK: Something wrong, Darnell?
DARNELL: Excuse me sir but, ma'am, if I didn't know better I would swear you were someone I left behind on Wrigley's Pleasure Planet. It's funny, you're exactly like a girl that
MCCOY: A little less mouth, Darnell.
DARNELL: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I mean, I know it's impossible, of course.
KIRK: Why don't you step outside, Darnell.
DARNELL: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
KIRK: Maybe I'll step outside, too.
NANCY: What? And let Plum examine me all alone?
KIRK: Plum?
MCCOY: Plum.
NANCY: A nickname I gave Leonard when we were very young.
MCCOY: I'll, er, I'll wait for the professor and I'll catch you both at once.
NANCY: I'd better go get Bob. Every time he starts digging he forgets time, sleep, food, everything. Be back in a minute.

[Planet surface outside building]

BLONDE NANCY: It's quite warm here, isn't it? (encourages Darnell to follow her)

Captain's log, additional entry. Since our mission was routine, we had beamed down to the planet without suspicion. We were unaware each member of the landing party was seeing a different woman, a different Nancy Crater.

[Crater's home]

KIRK: Professor Crater, I'm Captain Kirk. This is
CRATER: The heroic Captain and the intrepid doctor cross interstellar space to preserve our health. Your sense of duty is overwhelming. Now will you please go back where you came from and tell whoever issues your orders to leave me and my wife alone. We need salt against the heat. Aside from that, we're doing very well, thank you.
MCCOY: I'm pleased you're doing well but I'm required to confirm that fact.
CRATER: Doubtless the good surgeon will enjoy prodding and poking us with his arcane machinery. Go away, we don't want you.
MCCOY: What you want is unimportant right now. What you will get is required by the book.
KIRK: Quote. All research personnel on alien planets are required to have their health certified by a starship surgeon at one year intervals. Like it or not, Professor, as commander of the starship, I'm required
CRATER: To show your gold braid to everyone. You love it, don't you.
KIRK: He's all yours, Plum. Doctor McCoy.
MCCOY: Sit down and breathe deeply, please.
CRATER: Did I hear you call him Doctor McCoy?
MCCOY: You did.
CRATER: McCoy. I've heard Nancy speak of a Doctor McCoy.
MCCOY: That's me. Didn't she mention I was here?
CRATER: You've seen Nancy?
KIRK: She went out to get you.
CRATER: You've seen her too? You were with the good Doctor?
KIRK: Yes. Why?
CRATER: Nothing. It's just that it gives me pleasure to know that she's gotten to see an old friend and has a chance for some company. It's different for me, I enjoy solitude. But for a woman. You understand, of course.
MCCOY: Well, it certainly hasn't aged her. She looks exactly as I knew her twelve years ago. Amazing, Jim. Like a girl of twenty five.
CRATER: Sorry. I'm sorry, Captain, sit down. I seem to have forgotten my manners.
KIRK: Quite all right.
MCCOY: I'm not joking, Jim. She hasn't aged a day. She doesn't have a grey hair on her head.
KIRK: She's got some grey, Bones. Excuse me, Professor, she's a handsome woman, yes, but hardly twenty five.
CRATER: You've seen my wife with the eyes of your past attachment, Doctor. I'm sure when Nancy lets, when you see her again she'll be a believable age.
MCCOY: Well at any rate she doesn't look a day over thirty.
CRATER: Genuine affection. I'm glad you still feel it for her. Leonard, isn't it? She's a fine woman.
MCCOY: Open your mouth.
CRATER: Why, I thought the machine
MCCOY: The machine is capable of almost anything but I'll still put my trust in a healthy set of tonsils. Now, open your mouth. (a woman screams, they dash out, Kirk with his phaser drawn)

[Planet surface]

(Darnell is lying on a rock, Nancy is standing by him)
KIRK: (removing a piece of plant from Darnell's mouth) McCoy.
MCCOY: Dead, Jim. Strange. A red mottling all over his face.
KIRK: What happened?
CRATER: What do you suppose happened, Captain? You beam down a crewman who doesn't know better than to eat an untested plant.
KIRK: I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater. I want to know what happened.
NANCY: Well, I, I
MCCOY: Take it easy, Nancy. Just tell us what you know.
NANCY: I was just. I couldn't find Bob, and I was coming back. I crossed to your crewman. I wanted him to know I wasn't offended by the things he'd said back there. You remember. Then I, I noticed he had a Borgia plant in his hand. Before I could say anything, he, he'd taken a bite from it. He fell, his face all twisted, and. Leonard, you're looking at me like you don't believe me.
MCCOY: No, no, no, no, it's not that. It's something entirely different. Jim, I suppose we could complete these examinations later.
CRATER: We don't need an examination, you can see that. Perhaps you'd better take your man and
KIRK: We're well aware of our next duties, Professor. We'll complete your examinations tomorrow. Transporter room.
CREWMAN [OC]: Transporter room, Captain.
KIRK: Lock onto us. Three beaming up.
SCOTT [OC]: Locked onto you, Captain.
NANCY: Salt. You did ask them about more salt tablets?
CRATER: I'll take care of the provisioning, Nancy.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Miss Uhura, your last sub-space log contained an error in the frequencies column.
UHURA: Mister Spock, sometimes I think if I hear that word frequency once more, I'll cry.
SPOCK: Cry?
UHURA: I was just trying to start a conversation.
SPOCK: Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to resent the word frequency, I have no answer.
UHURA: No, you have an answer. I'm an illogical woman who's beginning to feel too much a part of that communications console. Why don't you tell me I'm an attractive young lady, or ask me if I've ever been in love? Tell me how your planet Vulcan looks on a lazy evening when the moon is full.
SPOCK: Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura.
UHURA: I'm not surprised, Mister Spock.
CREWMAN [OC]: Transporter room to Bridge. Landing party returning. They report one death.
SPOCK: Bridge acknowledging.
UHURA: I don't believe it.
SPOCK: Explain.
UHURA: You explain. That means that somebody is dead and you just sit there. It could be Captain Kirk. He's the closest thing you have to a friend.
SPOCK: Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what happened. The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call if they need my assistance.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: She called it a Borgia plant.
KIRK: Something new to me.
SPOCK [OC]: Bridge to Dispensary.
KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Spock.
SPOCK [on monitor]: Borgia plant listed in library record tapes as carbon group three vegetation similar to Earth nightshade family. Alkaloid poison. Chemical structure common to class M planets. About the strange mottling on his facial skin surface. There is no reference to this symptom.
MCCOY: Hmm. Well then, this man wasn't poisoned.
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. She said she saw him eat the plant.
MCCOY: She's mistaken. I know alkaloid poison, what to look for. There's not a trace of it in his body.
KIRK: There were bits of the plant in his mouth.
MCCOY: Jim, don't tell me my business. He could not have swallowed any. My instruments would have picked up any trace of it whatsoever.
KIRK: Then what kills a healthy man
MCCOY: I'll tell you something else. This man shouldn't be dead. I can't find anything wrong with him. According to all the tests he should just get up and walk away from here. I don't know. I'll have the tests double-checked. My eyes may be tricking me. I swear, Jim, when I first saw her she looked just as I'd known her ten years ago. Granted, for a moment I may have been looking at her through a romantic haze.
KIRK: How your lost love affects your vision, Doctor, doesn't interest me. I've lost a man. I want to know what killed him.
MCCOY: Yes, sir.

Captain's log, Stardate 1513.4. In orbit around planet M-113. One crewman, member of the landing party, dead by violence. Cause unknown, but we are certain the cause of death was not poison.

[Bridge]

UHURA: Message, Captain. Starship base on Caran 4 requesting explanation of our delay here, sir. Space Commander Dominguez says we have supplies he urgently needs.
Tell Jose he'll get his chili peppers when we get there. Tell him they're prime Mexican reds. I handpicked them myself, but he won't die if he goes a few more days without them. Got it?
UHURA: Got it, Captain.
KIRK: Well?
SPOCK: No mistake in our record tapes. Borgia plant. Its sole deadly property is alkaloid poison.
KIRK: And Professor Crater and wife?
SPOCK: Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago. Visited by various vessels, made fairly heavy shipments out, of artefacts and reports. However, there has been a marked drop in shipments during the last year.
MCCOY [OC]: Dispensary to Captain.
KIRK: Kirk here.
MCCOY [OC]: We found something.
KIRK: What is it?
MCCOY: I'd rather not put it on the speaker.

[Sickbay]

SPOCK: Fascinating.
MCCOY: So improbable we almost didn't check it.
KIRK: What?
SPOCK: Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it.
MCCOY: This man has no salt in his body at all.
KIRK: Can you explain that, Doctor?
MCCOY: I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is gone from his.
SPOCK: He would die almost instantly.
KIRK: How? There isn't a mark on his body.
MCCOY: Except the red rings on his face.
KIRK: You called that skin mottling.
MCCOY: I thought it was, sir. Another error on my part.
KIRK: I'm not counting them, Bones. Are you in the mood for an apology?
MCCOY: Oh, forget it. I probably was mooning over her. I should have been thinking about my job.
KIRK: Perhaps you were. Both Nancy and Crater went out of their way to mention one item they needed.
MCCOY: Salt tablets.
KIRK: Mister Spock, outfit a landing party. We're beaming down with some questions.

[Crater's home]

CRATER: One might think that you had more important duties than harassing people, Captain.
KIRK: I have, Professor. Believe me, I have. Where is Mrs. Crater? I want to talk to her, too.
CRATER: Captain, you can't just beam down here and bully us, and interfere with our work.
KIRK: Mrs. Crater. I won't ask again.
CRATER: Possibly at the other diggings. We don't keep military logs
KIRK: Green, find her.
GREEN: Yes, sir. (leaves)
KIRK: Mister Spock.
SPOCK [OC]: Standing by.
KIRK: Sturgeon, transport a sample of the plant to Mister Spock. We'll check if it's actually the Borgia plant or something we don't understand. (Sturgeon leaves) You got that, Mister Spock?
SPOCK [OC]: Complete analysis.
CRATER: Captain, considering the inescapable fact that you are a trespasser on my planet
KIRK: Your complaint is noted, sir. Look, something we don't understand killed one of my men. It could prove to be a danger to you and Mrs. Crater, too.
CRATER: We've been here for almost five years. If there were anything hostile here we would know about it, wouldn't we?
KIRK: Bones, tell the professor what the autopsy revealed.
MCCOY: Our crewman died of salt depletion. Sudden, total loss of it. Medically impossible by any standards.
KIRK: And by coincidence, both you and Mrs. Crater requested salt tablets.
CRATER: And your esteemed physician cannot explain our need for salt tablets?
KIRK: We're all aware of the need for salt on a hot and arid planet like this, Professor, but it's a mystery, and I don't like mysteries. They give me a bellyache and I've got a beauty right now.
CRATER: (opening storage box) Nancy and I started with twenty five pounds. This is what we have left. (a few tablets at the bottom of a jar) Now what is so mysterious about that?
MCCOY: (checking tablets) Salt.
KIRK: One of the missions of the Enterprise is to protect human life in places like this. I'm going to have to ask you and Mrs. Crater to stay aboard my ship until we find out what killed that crewman.
CRATER: But you can't do that.
KIRK: But I can, Professor.
How? You've been here five years. Will a couple of days make a difference? Mister Spock.
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here.
KIRK: Arrange quarters for Professor and Mrs. Crater. Did you get the plant analysis?
SPOCK [OC]: It is the Borgia variety, Captain. Could not have caused Darnell's death.
MCCOY: Jim, he's run off.


(Crater finds Sturgeon's body)
CRATER: Nancy! You! Salt! I've got salt! Smell it! Smell it, Nancy!
(Nancy is kneeling by Green's body. She stands at the call)
KIRK [OC]: Professor Crater! Professor Crater!
MCCOY [OC]: Professor Crater!
KIRK: Professor Crater! Professor! Professor!
MCCOY: Jim! Jim, it's Sturgeon. He's dead.
KIRK: We'd better locate Crewman Green. Green! Green! Crewman Green, report! Green!
(Nancy changes into Green)
MCCOY: Crewman Green, report! Green! Green, where are you? Could it be Crater? He came this way.
KIRK: I don't know. Green! (Green arrives) Did you see this?
GREEN: Yes, sir. Sturgeon was dead when I found him. I was circling to find whatever it was.
MCCOY: Same red rings on his face. Have you seen Nancy, Mrs. Crater?
GREEN: No, sir. I checked all through the ruins.
MCCOY: I'm worried about her, Jim. She's not at the quarters, she's not at the diggings. She could be in trouble. Nancy!
KIRK: Crater!
MCCOY: Nancy, it's Leonard!
KIRK: We're beaming aboard the ship, Doctor.
MCCOY: You can't leave her!
KIRK: We can't search this whole planet on foot.
MCCOY: Jim!
KIRK: You could learn something from Mister Spock, Doctor. Stop thinking with your glands. We've equipment aboard the Enterprise that could pinpoint a match lit anywhere on this planet, or the heat of a body. Transporter room, Kirk speaking. Three to beam up.

[Transporter room]

KIRK: Kirk to Bridge.
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here.
KIRK: Break out the surface search equipment. I want co-ordinates on two people.
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledged.
KIRK: There's a body down there. Sturgeon.
TRANSPORTER OPERATOR: We'll bring him home, sir.
KIRK: You could use some sleep, Bones.
MCCOY: All right, Jim.

[Turbolift]

KIRK: Bridge.

[Corridor]

RAND: Oh, Green, what went on down there? (he reaches for the salt cellar) Who do you think you are?
(they enter turbolift)

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Something odd, Captain. You said two people.
KIRK: Professor and Nancy Crater.
SPOCK: We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater. He's circling as if searching for something.
KIRK: Expand search radius.
SPOCK: Yes, sir.

[Corridor]

(Green is following Rand)
RAND: Why don't you go chase an asteroid?
REDSHIRT: Hey, Janice, is that for me?
RAND: Don't you wish it was?
BLUESHIRT: How about that?
REDSHIRT: Yeah, how'd you like to have her as your personal yeoman?

[Life Sciences Section - Botany department]

RAND: Where are you, Sulu?
SULU: In here feeding the weepers, Janice.
RAND: I've got your tray.
SULU: May the Great Bird of the Galaxy bless your planet.
RAND: Thank you. Hello, Beauregard. How are you today, darling?
SULU: Her name's Gertrude.
RAND: No, it's a he plant. A girl can tell.
SULU: Why do people have to call inanimate objects she, like she's a fast ship.
RAND: He is not an inanimate object. He's so animate he makes me nervous. In fact, I keep expecting one of these plants of yours to grab me.
SULU: Hello, Green.
RAND: He's not talking today. You been nipping saurian brandy or something?
(Beauregard starts screeching and slithers down into it's stem. Green rushes out)
SULU: (stroking plant) Take it easy. Calm down. Very sensitive.
RAND: He's the real spook. Suppose he's going space happy or something?

[Corridor]

UHURA (to crewmen) The door to my quarters still rattles when it opens. Would you stop by and see if you can do something about it? Thanks, Bobby. (Green changes into African crewman) Crewman, do I know you?
CREWMAN: In a way, ma'am. You were just thinking of someone like me. I'm guessing of course, but you do look a little lonely.
UHURA: I see. So naturally, when I'm lonely I think of you.
CREWMAN: Ina cuvanea mwanamke turee.
UHURA: Una kafeeri Hur. You're Swahili?
KIRK [OC]: Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge. (the crewman begins to reach for her face) Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge.
RAND: I'd better get this tray back. Bye, Beauregard.
SULU: Wait a minute, I'll walk along.
KIRK [OC]: Lieutenant Uhura, report to the Bridge.
UHURA: Lieutenant Uhura. On my way, sir.

[McCoy's quarters]

MCCOY: McCoy to Bridge. Captain there?
KIRK [on monitor]: Kirk here. Nothing to report, Doctor. We haven't located Mrs. Crater. What's the matter, can't you sleep?
MCCOY: Nope.
KIRK [on monitor]: Try taking one of those red pills you gave me last week. You'll sleep.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with the ship's equipment, there's only one person within a one hundred mile circle.
KIRK: All right. We'll triangulate on him. We'll let Professor Crater explain what happened to his wife. (to Uhura) Remember my instructions, Lieutenant. Keep a tight fix on us. If we let out a yell I want an armed party down there before the echo dies.
UHURA: Yes, Captain.

[McCoy's quarters]

(Uhura's crewman has found McCoy's quarters, and transforms into Nancy)
MCCOY: Nancy. Well, come in. come in. I've been worried sick about you. I wonder why Jim didn't tell me he found you.
NANCY: I'm so happy to see you, Leonard. The others, they, I, I don't relate to them as much as you. You have such strong memories of me.
MCCOY: Well.
NANCY: You do care, don't you, Leonard? It makes me feel so, so safe.
MCCOY: Nancy, er
NANCY: My husband? I like your feelings better. Much stronger. But you're tired, You need to rest.
MCCOY: You're as bad as Jim Kirk. He's been telling me to take these.
NANCY: I think you should. I'll get you some water.

[Corridor]

(a crewman lies dead, with mottles on his face)
RAND: Look at his face!
SULU: Bridge. Sulu. Trouble on deck nine, section two. We need a medical team.

Captain's log, Stardate 1513.8. I am now certain that the violent death of my crewmen was caused by some strange life-form.

[McCoy's quarters]

MCCOY: (lying on bed) I was so worried. Your husband acting strange, crewmen dying.
NANCY: You're so tired, darling. Just rest now.
UHURA [OC]: Medical department alert. Doctors and medics acknowledge.
NANCY: It's nothing, dear. It's nothing. You just sleep. Nancy will take care of everything.
UHURA [OC]: Dr. McCoy to the Bridge. Dr. McCoy to the Bridge. (Nancy changes to McCoy) Dr. McCoy to the Bridge.

Captain's log, additional. Armed and able-bodied crewmen are not attacked and slaughtered this easily. Apparently, the killer can immobilize them as it approaches perhaps with some hypnotic or paralysing power. The answer lies with Professor Crater.

[Planet surface - ruins]

KIRK: Professor Crater.
CRATER: Go away! We don't want you here.
KIRK: We? Where's your wife, Professor? We're concerned about her.
CRATER: I'm armed. Go away.
KIRK: Where's your wife, Professor?
CRATER: She's no concern of yours.
KIRK: We're worried about her safety. Aren't you? Professor, you're a reasonable man, let me (comm. beep) Kirk here.
SULU [OC]: Casualty, Captain. Barnhart was found dead on deck nine. Same symptoms.
SPOCK: Spock cutting in, Captain. Something here, through the arches to your left.
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Sulu. Spock has something.
SPOCK: Green.
KIRK: He beamed up to the ship with us.
SPOCK: Or something did.
KIRK: Enterprise from Kirk.
SULU [OC]: Bridge. Sulu.
KIRK: You have an intruder aboard. Could be masquerading as Crewman Green. General quarters, security condition three.
SULU [OC]: GQ security three, sir.

[Corridor]

SULU [OC]: General quarters three. Intruder alert. GQ three. Intruder alert. General quarters three. Intruder alert. GQ three. Intruder alert.
UHURA [OC]: Reporting GQ three secure, Captain. Do you require assistance there?
SPOCK: Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive.
KIRK: Negative, Lieutenant, but keep locked in on us. Kirk out. Let's get him. (phaser fire)
CRATER: We don't want you here! We're happy alone! I'll kill to stay alone. You hear that, Kirk? Or you'll have to kill me. II don't care either way.
SPOCK: Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult.
KIRK: Set your phaser on one quarter. I'll leave mine on stun.
SPOCK: Why risk your life for his?
KIRK: He's not trying to kill us, he's trying to frighten us, and he's doing a pretty good job.

[Bridge]

SULU: GQ three now secured except for decks five, seven, and ten. Come in, please.
UHURA: He's not in supply and maintenance.
SULU: Go to Engineering now. Run through file photos of the crewmen there.
UHURA: Check.
SECURITY [OC]: Deck five reporting. Crewman Green is not in his quarters. No one has seen him
SULU: Keep in mind if you find him, he's not Crewman Green. The Captain reports Crewman Green is dead.
RAND: And he, or rather it, followed me. I thought there was something twitchy about him.
SULU: He, whatever, was probably your crewman, too, Lieutenant.
UHURA: He must have been it. You know, I would have remembered a crewman like him.
MCCOY: The creature leading you a merry chase, Mister Sulu?
SULU: The creature?
MCCOY: Or whatever it is that's killing the crewmen. Perhaps I can help. Fill me in.

[Planet surface - ruins]

(Spock and Kirk are circling around Crater from different directions)
KIRK: Set.
SPOCK: Acknowledged. Crater! (Kirk fires his phaser)
KIRK: Your wife, Professor. Where is she? Your wife, Professor. Where is she?
CRATER: She was the last of her kind.
KIRK: The last of her kind?
CRATER: The last of its kind. Earth history, remember? Like the passenger pigeon or buffalo. Ooh! I feel strange.
KIRK: Just stunned. You'll be able to think in a minute.
SPOCK: The Earth buffalo. What about it?
CRATER: Once there were millions of them prairies black with them. One herd covered three whole states, and when they moved they were like thunder.
SPOCK: And now they're gone. Is that what you mean?
CRATER: Like the creatures here. Once there were millions of them. Now there's one left. Nancy understood.
SPOCK: Always in the past tense.
KIRK: Where's your wife? Where is she now?
CRATER: Dead. Buried up on the hill. It killed her.
KIRK: When?
CRATER: Oh, a year, or was it two?
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.
SULU [OC]: Bridge to Captain. Sulu here.
KIRK: It's definite, Mister Sulu. The intruder can assume any shape. Crewmen, you, myself, anyone. Do you understand?
SULU [OC]: Affirmative, Captain.
KIRK: Go to GQ four.
SULU [OC]: General quarters four, Captain.
CRATER: The creature was trying to survive. It has that right, doesn't it?
KIRK: Kirk to transporter room. Three to beam up.
CRATER: They needed salt to stay alive. There was no more salt. It's the last one. The buffalo. There is no difference.
KIRK: There's one, Professor. Your creature is killing my people.

Captain's log, continuing. The Enterprise has been invaded by a creature capable of assuming any form, and with the capacity to paralyse and draw the life from any one of us.

[Corridor]

SULU [OC]: Deck five, section three. Deck five, section three. Report.
SECURITY: Security 3 A here. 3 B in sight.

[Briefing room]

UHURA: Negative, Captain. I've checked every face on this vessel. It was not a crewman I saw.
KIRK: Yeoman Rand, how long was this Green with you?
RAND: As long as he, it thought it could get to the salt on my tray, sir.
KIRK: Mister Spock?
SPOCK: Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and engineering levels, Captain. However, no one or nothing has approached them as yet.
KIRK: Dr. McCoy?
MCCOY: Yes?
KIRK: Medical department report, Doctor.
MCCOY: Oh. Well, we could offer it salt without tricks. There's no reason for it to attack us.
SPOCK: Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is reckless.
CRATER: (eyeing McCoy carefully) The creature is not dangerous when fed.
MCCOY: No, it's simply trying to survive by using its natural ability to take other forms.
CRATER: The way the chameleon uses its protective colouring, an ability retained no doubt from its primitive state, the way we have retained our incisor teeth. They were once fangs. Certain of our muscles were designed for chase. It uses its ability the way we would use our muscles and teeth if necessary, to stay alive.
MCCOY: And like us, it's an intelligent animal. There's no need to hunt it down.
SPOCK: A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room.
SULU [on monitor] All the halls sealed off. All weapons accounted for and locked away. Security four in effect on every level. Still no lead on intruder.
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Continue the search. Crater, we don't know who or what we're looking for. We need your help, and now.
CRATER: I demanded, I even begged that you get off my planet.
KIRK: Can you recognise this thing When you see it? Professor, I'll forego charges up to this point but this creature's aboard my ship and I'll have it, or I'll have your skin, or both. Now where is it?
CRATER: I loved Nancy very much. Few women like my Nancy. She lives in my dreams. She walks and sings in them.
KIRK: And it becomes Nancy for you.
CRATER: Not because of tricks. It doesn't trick me. It needs love as much as it needs salt. When it killed Nancy, I almost destroyed it but, it isn't just a beast. It is intelligent and the last of its kind.
KIRK: You bleed too much, Crater. You're too pure and noble. Are you saving the last of its kind or has this become Crater's private heaven, here on this planet? This thing becomes wife, lover, best friend, wise man, fool, idol, slave. It isn't a bad life to have everyone in the universe at your beck and call, and you win all the arguments.
CRATER: You don't understand.
KIRK: Have you learned to see this thing in whatever form it becomes?
CRATER: Yes.
KIRK: Are you going to help us find it?
CRATER: Sorry, I can't.
SPOCK: Recommend we use truth serum, Captain.
KIRK: Doctor?
MCCOY: Well, I resist using it, but in this case the professor will give us the truth.
KIRK: Take him.
SPOCK: I'll accompany you, Doctor.
MCCOY: Oh, yes. Of course.

[Corridor]

CREWMAN [OC]: Captain Kirk to dispensary. Captain Kirk to dispensary.

[Sickbay]

SPOCK: (on biobed) It wasn't McCoy. It was the creature. It hit me. Crater grabbed my phaser. I wondered about McCoy. Doubt had crossed my mind.
RAND: Captain. Professor Crater.
KIRK: Dead. But it had you, too.
SPOCK: Fortunately, my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours did. My blood cells are quite different.

[McCoy's quarters]

NANCY: Leonard. Leonard, wake up. Please help me. Help me, Leonard. They're trying to kill me. Don't let them kill me!
MCCOY: Easy, easy. Nobodies going to
NANCY: But you must help me!
KIRK: Move aside, Bones.
MCCOY: What's going on here, Jim?
KIRK: She's not Nancy, Bones.
MCCOY: Are you insane?
KIRK: It killed four crewmen. Now Crater.
MCCOY: It?
KIRK: The creature. It kills. It needs salt to live. Bones, move aside.
MCCOY: No!
KIRK: My guess is she needs more. You want it, Nancy? Come and get it.
MCCOY: You're frightening her, Jim.
KIRK: Not fright. Hunger. Look at her.
NANCY: Leonard, if you love me, make him go away.
KIRK: Come on. You want this, Nancy? Come on Nancy. Come and get it. Come and get it. Here it is.
NANCY: Leonard, help me.
MCCOY: Stop it, Jim!
KIRK: McCoy, get out of the way!
MCCOY: Are you out of your mind?
KIRK: Get out of the way.
(McCoy and Kirk struggle for the phaser while Nancy grabs and eats the salt tablets. McCoy wins and is pushed away, then she transfixes Kirk and reaches for his face)
SPOCK: It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly!
MCCOY: No! No!
(They struggle for the phaser. Spock gets between Nancy and Kirk.)
SPOCK: It's killing the captain! Shoot, quick!
MCCOY: I won't shoot Nancy.
SPOCK: This is not Nancy. (hitting her repeatedly) If she were Nancy, could she take this?
MCCOY: Stop it! Stop it, Spock! Stop it! (Nancy sends Spock flying with one slap)
SPOCK: Is that Nancy, Doctor?
MCCOY: No. (she goes to Kirk again) No!
(She transforms into her natural state. Kirk screams, McCoy fires the phaser, she changes back into Nancy)
NANCY: Leonard. Leonard, no. Leonard, please.
MCCOY: Lord, forgive me.
(He fires again and she dies)
KIRK: I'm sorry, Bones.

[Bridge]

SULU: Ready to leave orbit, Captain.
SPOCK: Something wrong, Captain?
KIRK: I was thinking about the buffalo, Mister Spock. Warp one, Mister Sulu.
SULU: Warp one, sir. Leaving orbit.
KIRK: All right, Chief, begin materialisation. Captain Ramart, I'm Captain Kirk.
RAMART: This is my navigator Tom Nellis.
KIRK: How do you do?
NELLIS: How do you do?
RAMART: And this is our young castaway Charlie, Charlie Evans. His dossier.
KIRK: Mister Evans. We've heard a great deal about you. Welcome aboard.
RAMART: Wonderful boy, Charlie. Its been an honour having him aboard.
NELLIS: Why, it's been a great pleasure. The things that he's learned in the last
RAMART: Absolutely. To think this boy spent practically his whole life alone on that planet. Everyone killed, just a few microtapes to learn from.
CHARLIE: How many humans like me on this ship?
RAMART: Like a whole city in space, Charlie. Over four hundred in the crew of a starship, aren't there, Captain?
KIRK: Four hundred and twenty eight, to be exact. Is there anything we can do for you, Captain? Medical supplies, provisions?
CHARLIE: Hundreds. All human, like me. That's exciting. Is that the right word?
NELLIS: That's perfect. It's the exact word.
RAMART: You see. We'd like to keep Charlie with us, but with his closest living relatives on Colony Five and your vessel going that way, why
CHARLIE: I'd like to see your ship now. All of it. The people and everything.
KIRK: You keep interrupting, Mister Evans. That's considered wrong.
CHARLIE: I'm sorry.
KIRK: We have a large supply of entertainment tapes, gentlemen.
RAMART: No, we've a tight schedule to make, Captain. Just twenty of us, we're making out fine.
KIRK: This must be a space first. A transport ship that doesn't need anything?
RAMART: Nothing.
KIRK: Not even Sarian brandy?
RAMART: We're fine, thank you. Pleasant journey, Captain.
KIRK: Thank you. (the pair are beamed off)
KIRK: Yeoman Rand, this is Charles Evans. Show him to his quarters and drop his records off at Doctor McCoy's office, if you will.
RAND: Yes, sir. Come with me, please.
CHARLIE: Are you a girl? Is that a girl?
KIRK: That's a girl.

Captain's Log, star date 1533.7. We have taken aboard an unusual passenger for transport to Colony Alpha Five. Charles Evans, the sole survivor of a transport crash fourteen years ago. The child, alone from age three, has not only survived, but has grown to intelligent, healthy adolescence.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Tell me. The ship's supply of food concentrates couldn't have lasted fourteen years.
CHARLIE: After that I found other things to eat, just growing around.
MCCOY: And you learned to talk by just listening to the ship's tapes?
CHARLIE: The memory banks still worked. They talked to me, and I talked back.
MCCOY: You're four-oh.
CHARLIE: Four?
MCCOY: Four-oh. One hundred percent. Sound of wind and limb.
CHARLIE: That, that Captain. Kirk?
MCCOY: Yeah.
CHARLIE: Why does he call me Mister Evans?
MCCOY: Because that's your name.
CHARLIE: He's not, well, he isn't like Captain Ramart.
MCCOY: Well, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Do you like me?
MCCOY: Why not?
CHARLIE: Some, the other ship, they didn't like me. I tried. I'm trying to make people like me. I want them to like me.
MCCOY: Most seventeen year olds do. Come on, let's go. I'll show you to your quarters.

[Corridor]

CREWMAN 1: Hey, I'll put the equipment away. See you in the rec room, huh?
CREWMAN 2: You got a deal, friend. (slaps man on bottom)
CREWMAN 1: All right. (to Charlie) Hello.
CHARLIE: I brought you a present.
(A bottle of perfume.)
RAND: Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it, but, but I have to go. I'm on duty.
CHARLIE: Do you like that kind?
RAND: Yes, I, it's my favourite. Where did you get it? They don't have any in the ship's stores.
CHARLIE: It's a present.
RAND: I know, but where did? Gee, I'm late, Charlie. I really have to go.
CHARLIE: Can't you stay and talk a little while?
RAND: Look, I'm off duty at fourteen hundred. Why don't you join me in recreation room six, deck three.
CHARLIE: You got a deal, friend. (slaps her bottom)
RAND: Charlie!
CHARLIE: I thought. Don't be angry. I didn't, I wanted.
RAND: Charlie, you, you, you just don't go around slapping girls on the. It's okay, but er, just don't do it again.
CHARLIE: Don't be angry.
RAND: Look, why don't you tell Captain Kirk or Doctor McCoy what you did. They'll explain it to you. Okay?
CHARLIE: I will.
RAND: Okay.

[Bridge]

MCCOY: But tell me, what reason would he have to lie if there are Thasians?
SPOCK: That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant, Captain.
KIRK: Good. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock is working out
UHURA: Excuse me, Captain. Status report.
KIRK: Thank you. He's working out a training programme for Charlie Evans. Earth history, his own background, that sort of thing. I'd like you to give him the necessary medical orientation on the problems of, um, er, adolescence.
MCCOY: Well, don't you think it'd be better for a strong father image like you? He already looks up to you.
KIRK: The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere.
SPOCK: Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians?
KIRK: Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still exist on that planet in some form?
SPOCK: Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year or so.
MCCOY: By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables.
SPOCK: Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life.
MCCOY: And probes have been known to be wrong, Spock.
MCCOY: Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally?
KIRK: Gentlemen, the fact is the boy is here and he's alive and he needs our help.
MCCOY: And he needs a guide and he needs a father image, Jim.
KIRK: Hmm. I'll depend on your astute abilities to supply him with that, or find him one.

[Recreation room]

(Spock is strumming his lyre when Uhura starts humming. Spock stops)
UHURA: I'm sorry. I did it again, didn't I.
(Spock smirks and Uhura begins playing again.)
UHURA: (singing) Oh, on the starship Enterprise There's someone who's in Satan's guise Whose devil ears and devil eyes Could rip your heart from you. At first, his look could hypnotise And then his touch would barbarise His alien love could victimise And rip your heart from you. And that's why female astronauts, Oh, very female astronauts Wait terrified and overwrought To find what he will do. Oh, girls in space, be wary, be wary, be wary, Girls in space, be wary. We know not what he'll do.
RAND: One more time!
UHURA: (singing) Now from a planet out in space, there comes a lad, not commonplace. A-seeking out his first embrace. He's saving it for you. Oh, Charlie's our new darling, our darling, our darling. Charlie's our new darling. We know not what he'll do.
(Uhura suddenly loses her voice and the lyre makes no sound.)
CHARLIE: Want to see something? (puts three cards face down) Turn them over. (They have pictures of Rand on them)
RAND: Well, how did you do that?
CHARLIE: Oh, I can do a lot of card tricks. One of the men on the Antares showed me.
(The cards return to normal)
RAND: I don't believe this!
(Hhe lays out the aces, throws one over his shoulder, then Rand removes it from her cleavage)

KIRK: On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving. If the crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf, I want it to look like turkey. Charlie.
CHARLIE: Captain? I'm supposed to ask you something. Why shouldn't I? I don't know how to explain it.
KIRK: Say it right out, Charlie. That usually works.
CHARLIE: Well, in the corridor I saw. When Janice, when Yeoman Rand was. (slaps Kirk's bottom) I did that to her. She didn't like it. She said you'd explain it to me.
KIRK: Me. I see. Well, um, er, there are things you can do with a lady, er, Charlie, that you er. There's no right way to hit a woman. I mean, man to man is one thing, but, er, man and woman, er, it's, er, it's, er. Well it's, er, another thing. Do you understand?
CHARLIE: I don't know.
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk.
KIRK: Excuse me. Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: Captain Ramart of the Antares is on D channel.
KIRK: I'm on my way to the Bridge now.
CHARLIE: Can I come with you?
KIRK: I don't think so, Charlie.
CHARLIE: I won't get in the way.
KIRK: Okay.

[Bridge]

UHURA: Can you boost your power, Antares. We're barely reading your transmission.
RAMART [OC]: We're at full output, Enterprise. I must speak to Captain Kirk.
KIRK: Kirk here, Captain Ramart.
RAMART [OC]: Captain, we're just barely in range. I've got to warn
KIRK: Re-establish contact.
UHURA: They're not transmitting.
KIRK: Keep trying.
CHARLIE: It wasn't very well constructed.
KIRK: Sweep the area of the Antares transmission with our probe scanners, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Affirmative, Captain.
KIRK: You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie?
CHARLIE: I don't know.
SPOCK: Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain.
KIRK: What about the Antares?
SPOCK: The debris is what's left of the Antares.
CHEF [OC]: Captain Kirk from ship's Galley.
KIRK: Kirk here.
CHEF [OC]: Sir, I put meat loaf in the ovens. There's turkeys in there now. Real turkeys.
KIRK: Chief, have you been
(Charlie laughs and leaves.)

Captain's Log, star date 1535.8. UESPA headquarters notified of the mysterious loss of science probe vessel Antares.

[Recreation room]

(Kirk and Spock are playing 3D chess)
SPOCK: Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares?
KIRK: A survey ship with twenty men aboard lost. No reason. Obviously, Captain Ramart was not aware of any trouble. I can't figure it.
SPOCK: My own concern is more immediate. The boy.
KIRK: I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time?
SPOCK: He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did.
KIRK: I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock. Come in, Charlie.
SPOCK: And again, check.
KIRK: Checkmate.
SPOCK: Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on occasion, Captain.
KIRK: I prefer to call it inspired.
SPOCK: As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours.
KIRK: You play chess, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Oh, I, I watched them play on the Antares. Can I try?
KIRK: I place you in the hands of our chess master.
(Kirk gets up and leaves)
SPOCK: The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically mathematic, Charlie. You put the white here and the black on the secondary level.
CHARLIE: I know what it is. Let's play.
SPOCK: Very well. (just three moves later) That was a mistake, Charlie.
CHARLIE: No, it wasn't.
SPOCK: Checkmate.
CHARLIE: No, it isn't.
SPOCK: If you'll excuse me.
(Spock leaves. Charlie melts the white chess pieces.)

[Corridor]

RAND: Oh, Charlie. I was looking for you. I'd like you to meet Tina Lawton, Yeoman Third Class. Charlie Evans.
TINA: Hello, Charlie.
RAND: I thought you might enjoy meeting someone your own age.
CHARLIE: Can I talk to you, alone.
RAND: Charlie, Tina's
TINA: Excuse me. I must be wanted somewhere.
RAND: That was, that was rude and completely uncalled-for.
CHARLIE: But I don't need her. I want to talk to you.
RAND: That's no excuse. You'd better learn that right now. You have to live with people, Charlie. You're not alone anymore.
CHARLIE: But she's not as. She doesn't. She's not the same. Not like you. She's, she's just a girl. You're, you smell like a girl. All the other girls on the ship they, they look just like Tina. You're the only one who looks like you. You can understand, can't you? You know about being with somebody? Wanting to be? If I had the whole universe I'd give it to you. When I see you, I feel like I'm hungry all over. Hungry. Do you know how that feels?

[Bridge]

KIRK: What?
RAND: I wasn't sure I should, er, talk to you about this.
KIRK: Charlie's a seventeen year old boy.
RAND: Exactly, and he's
KIRK: I talked to him about the swat.
RAND: It's not that. Captain, I've seen the look before, and if something isn't done, sooner or later I'm going to have to hurt him. Tell him to leave me alone, and that wouldn't be good for him right now. You see, I'm his first crush, his first love, and his first
KIRK: Yes, Yeoman, I'll talk to him. I'll look into it.
RAND: Thank you, sir.

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK: Come in, Charlie. Er, Charlie. Charlie, do you know anything about this chess piece? Did you notice anything peculiar in them when we were using them this afternoon?
CHARLIE: No, sir. Is that all?
KIRK: Er, no. No, no. Sit down. Charlie, being seventeen is more than how many years you've lived. It's a whole other thing. Doctor McCoy could probably explain the biological conditions. Well, let's, let's use a specific. Yeoman Rand is a woman.
CHARLIE: Oh, I won't hit her like that anymore.
KIRK: No, there's more to it than that.
CHARLIE: Everything I do or say is wrong. I'm in the way, I don't know the rules, and when I learn something and try to do it, suddenly I'm wrong!
KIRK: Now wait, wait.
CHARLIE: I don't know what I am or what I'm supposed to be, or even who. I don't know why I hurt so much inside all the time.
KIRK: You'll live, believe me. There's nothing wrong with you that hasn't gone wrong with every other human male since the model first came up.
CHARLIE: What if you care for someone? What do you do?
KIRK: You go slow. You be gentle. I mean, it's not a one-way street, you know, how you feel and that's all. It's how the girl feels, too. Don't press, Charlie. If the girl feels anything for you at all, you'll know it. Do you understand?
CHARLIE: You don't think Janice. You. She could love me!
KIRK: She's not the girl, Charlie. The years are wrong, for one thing, and there are other things.
CHARLIE: She can.
KIRK: No, Charlie.
CHARLIE: She is.
KIRK: No.
CHARLIE: But if I did what you said! If I was gentle!
KIRK: Charlie, there are a million things in this universe you can have and there are a million things you can't have. It's no fun facing that, but that's the way things are.
CHARLIE: Then what am I going to do?
KIRK: Hang on tight and survive. Everybody does.
CHARLIE: You don't.
KIRK: Everybody, Charlie. Me, too.
CHARLIE: I'm trying, but I don't know how.
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: You asked to be notified when we were to make our course adjustments, sir.
KIRK: Ask Mister Spock to see to it. Charlie, come on with me.

[Gymnasium]

KIRK: You've got to slap the floor to absorb the energy when you fall. Go ahead, try it. Like everything else, it takes practice, Charlie. Try again. Good. That's much better. Here, now I'll show you a shoulder roll. Try that.
CHARLIE: I don't want to do that.
KIRK: Well, it makes it hard to teach you
CHARLIE: I don't want to do that.
KIRK: All right, Charlie. Lesson's over for today.
CHARLIE: You were going to teach me how to fight.
KIRK: You have to learn to protect yourself in a fall before I do that. It's more than teaching you to defend yourself. Charlie, I want you to learn. Charlie? Hey, Sam, let me borrow you for a couple easy throws, all right?
SAM: Right.
KIRK: Watch this, Charlie. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now I'll throw him. Here we go, Sam.
CHARLIE: That looks hard.
SAM: Oh.
KIRK: Come on, Charlie. Try it. Attaboy. Let's go.
(Charlie can't make Kirk lose his balance. He gets dumped instead.)
CHARLIE: Oh!
(Sam laughs.)
KIRK: That wasn't so bad, was it?
CHARLIE: Don't laugh at me.
KIRK: Cool off.
CHARLIE: Don't laugh at me!
(Sam disappears.)
KIRK: Charlie.
CHARLIE: He shouldn't have done that. It's not nice to laugh at people.
KIRK: What happened to him, Charlie?
CHARLIE: He's gone.
KIRK: That's no answer.
CHARLIE: He's gone! I didn't mean to do that. He made me do it! He laughed at me.
CREWMAN [OC]: Bridge.
KIRK: Kirk here. Two men from security, on the double.
CREWMAN [OC]: Affirmative.
CHARLIE: What are you going to do to me?
KIRK: I'm confining you to quarters. I want you to stay there.
CHARLIE: I won't let them hurt me. I'll make them go away, too.
KIRK: They won't hurt you, Charlie. (security arrive) They'll take you to your quarters, Charlie. Go with them.
(Charlie knocks them down, one draws his phaser)
CHARLIE: No! (phaser disappears)
KIRK: Go to your quarters.
CHARLIE: He was going to hurt me.
KIRK: Go to your quarters or I'll pick you up and carry you there.
CHARLIE: I won't let you.
KIRK: That's your choice, Charlie.
CHARLIE: I won't let them hurt me.
KIRK: They won't hurt you.
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk.
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: Security reports that all phaser weapons have disappeared. Shall I repeat, Captain?
KIRK: No, I heard you. Have Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock meet me in the Briefing room.

[Briefing room]

SPOCK: Thasians have been referred to in our records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances invisible. It has generally been regarded as legend, but Charlie does seems to possess this same power.
KIRK: What are chances that Charlie's not an Earthling, that he's a Thasian?
MCCOY: No, I don't think so, not unless they're exactly like Earthlings. The development of his fingers and toes exactly matches the present development of mans on Earth.
SPOCK: Agreed.
KIRK: Well, whatever he is, we have some idea of the power he has. I know what I saw him do in the gymnasium.
MCCOY: Considering the effect a normal adolescent has on a home, Charlie with the power he has
KIRK: Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand. He needs, he wants. Nothing happens fast enough.
SPOCK: The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life.
KIRK: He doesn't understand what life is. He's a boy.
MCCOY: Well, what do we do with this boy, Jim? How do we keep him caged up?
KIRK: It goes even further than that, Doctor. We can't take him with us to Earth Colony Five. Can you imagine what he'd do in an open, normal environment. I've talked with him, listened. He's a boy in a man's body, trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the way.
SPOCK: And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone, anywhere on this ship.
MCCOY: Well, for the moment he's stopped. You're an authority he respects, Jim.
SPOCK: Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any of us interfere
(Charlie enters under guard)
CHARLIE: You wanted to ask me something, he said.
KIRK: Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Why?
KIRK: Answer me.
CHARLIE: Yes. There was a warped baffle-plate on the shield of their energy pile. I made it go away. It would've blown up anyway. Well they weren't nice to me! They wanted to get rid of me. They don't now.
KIRK: What about us, Charlie?
CHARLIE: I don't know.
(Charlie leaves)
SPOCK: We're in the hands of an adolescent.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Lieutenant, raise Colony Five. I want to speak directly to the governor.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Navigator, lay a course away from Colony Five. Buy me some time.
NAVIGATOR: Yes, sir.
(Uhura's console short-circuits and she is thrown to the floor)
KIRK: Spock, get the doctor up here on the double. How bad is it?
UHURA: I think it's all right, sir. Sir, there's no reason for that panel to cross-circuit like that. I checked it over myself not fifteen minutes ago.
NAVIGATOR: Captain! I can't feed any course co-ordinates into the panel, sir. It rejects the course change.
PILOT: Helm doesn't respond either, sir. (Charlie enters)
KIRK: Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments?
SPOCK: Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest of the night.
KIRK: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's Martian red.
CHARLIE: You're trying to change course, Captain. You can't do that. I want to get to Colony Five as soon as we can.
KIRK: Release the transmitter.
CHARLIE: You don't need all that subspace chatter.
MCCOY: What's going on here? Spock calls me to the Bridge and goes into some kind of poetry.
KIRK: See to her, Doctor.
SPOCK: Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary.
CHARLIE: Very nice, Mister Ears. Oh, I can make him do anything, whirl around, laugh, anything.
KIRK: That's enough, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Don't you think he's funny? I think he's funny.
KIRK: Leave my crew alone. (Charlie leaves)
SPOCK: Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down.
KIRK: I know.

[Corridor]

TINA: Charlie, what's wrong? (he turns her into an iguana)

[Rand's quarters]

CHARLIE: I have something for you. (a rose) Pink is your favourite, isn't it?
RAND: You don't walk into a room without knocking.
CHARLIE: Don't ever lock your door on me again, Janice. I love you.
RAND: I'll lock it when I please. What is it you want, anyway?
CHARLIE: You. I only want to be nice to you. I can give you anything. Just, just tell me.
RAND: (switching on comm.) I want you to get out.

[Bridge]

CHARLIE [OC]: But I only want to be nice to you.
RAND [OC]: Get out, Charlie.
KIRK: Spock.
RAND [OC]: I can't make it any plainer than that.

[Rand's quarters]

CHARLIE: I love you.
RAND: You don't know what the word means.
CHARLIE: Then show me.
RAND: No!
(Kirk and Spock rush in, Charlie knocks them down.)
RAND: Charlie!
(She slaps him, so he makes her disappear.)
CHARLIE: Why did she do that? I loved her, but she wasn't nice at all. What you did wasn't nice either, but I still need you, Captain. The Enterprise isn't quite like the Antares. Running the Antares was easy. You have to be nice. All right? (gives pain)
KIRK: Mister Spock?
SPOCK: My legs. They're broken.
KIRK: Let him go, too, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Why?
KIRK: Because I'm telling you to. Because you need me to run the ship, and I need him.
CHARLIE: If you try to hurt me again, I'll make a lot of people go away.
KIRK: And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed?
CHARLIE: I won't tell you. Growing up isn't so much. I'm not a man, and I can do anything! You can't.

[Corridor]

SPOCK: I'll activate the force field myself. You can return to your section.
CHARLIE: He had a mean look. I had to freeze him. I like happy looks. (enters room) Aren't you coming in?
(A forcefield activates in the doorway so Charlie makes the wall go away and freezes Kirk and Spock.)
CHARLIE: That wasn't nice. You'll be sorry. You wait, you'll see, you'll be sorry you did that. (unfreezes them) You will.
(He turns a young woman into an old one. Some crew are laughing in a room.)
CHARLIE: No. No laughing!
(The shadows freeze, then a woman with no face feels her way around the corner)

[Bridge]

UHURA: Captain Kirk, my instruments show we're receiving a message on subspace frequency three, ship-to-ship. I can't hear it, sir.
KIRK: Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one that's coming in.
CHARLIE: It's my game, Captain. You have to find out. Like you said, that's how the game's played. You can have it now. I've locked on course for Colony Five again. (leaves)
KIRK: I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on.
MCCOY: You don't have any special immunity. Not anymore. Pushed far enough, he'd send you off to oblivion, too.
KIRK: Mister Spock?
SPOCK: Out of the question.
KIRK: Wait a minute. Does Charlie? Now, wait, Spock, has he done away with anybody since he took over?
SPOCK: Not so far as we know.
KIRK: Maybe he can't. Could be he's overreached himself. It's a big ship. He's taken full control. If we could tax his power, turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of it, and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you could tranquilize him, keep him under until we reach Colony Five.
MCCOY: Risky, Jim.
KIRK: If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway. There's no choice, gentlemen, none at all.
CHARLIE: I can make you all go away anytime I want to.
KIRK: Get out of my chair, Charlie, and get out of it now.
CHARLIE: I've got your ship, Captain.
KIRK: Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more. I think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing, but you're going to have to.
CHARLIE: I could've sent you away before, but I didn't.
KIRK: You're going to have to take me on.
CHARLIE: Don't make me do it now.
KIRK: You've got my ship, and I want it back. I want my crew back, whole, if I have to break your neck to do it! (throws him out of command chair)
CHARLIE: Don't push me. (gives Kirk pain) Sorry. I'm sorry but. Stop it. I said stop it!
SPOCK: Captain, the navigation console is clear now. The ship is answering the helm.
UHURA: Sir, something off our starboard bow. The message says they're from Thasus.
(Rand reappears)
CHARLIE: Oh.
RAND: Captain, how did I?
KIRK: It's all right, Yeoman.
SPOCK: Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors indicate no solid substance.
CHARLIE: No! Oh, no, please, don't let them take me. I can't live with them anymore. You're my friends. You said you were my friends, remember? When I came aboard! Please, I want to go home. Take me home.
THASIAN: I have taken my form from centuries ago, so that I may communicate with you. We did not realise until too late that the boy had gone, and we are saddened that his escape cost the lives of the first ship. We could not help them, but we have returned your people and your ship to you. Everything is as it was.
CHARLIE: I won't do it again. Please, I'll be good. I won't ever do it again. I'm sorry about the Antares. I'm sorry! When I came aboard! Please, I want to go with you. Help me!
KIRK: The boy belongs with his own kind.
THASIAN: That would be impossible.
KIRK: With training, we can teach him to live in our society. If he can be taught not to use his power
THASIAN: We gave him the power so he could live. He will use it, always, and he would destroy you and your kind, or you would be forced to destroy him to save yourselves.
KIRK: Is there nothing you can do?
THASIAN: We offer him life, and we will take care of him. Come, Charles.
CHARLIE: Oh, please, don't let them take me. I can't even touch them! Janice, they can't feel. Not like you! They don't love! Please, I want to stay. (fades away)
UHURA: Charlie's back on board the Thasian ship, sir. They signal they're leaving.
KIRK: It's all right, Yeoman. It's all over now.
SPOCK: Check out the life-support systems.
TORMOLEN: Right, sir. All life systems were off, sir.
SPOCK: Someone strangled this woman.
TORMOLEN The other four are back there.
SPOCK: Dead?
TORMOLEN: Right, sir.
SPOCK: Engineer at his post?
TORMOLEN He's frozen there like he didn't care.
SPOCK: The rest?
TORMOLEN: Well, better look for yourself, Mister Spock. One man was taking a shower fully clothed. (they split up, he takes off his glove to scratch his nose then puts it on the console. Something orange jumps onto his skin. Feeling the cold he puts the glove back on)
SPOCK: Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you read, Enterprise?
KIRK [OC]: Kirk, affirmative.
SPOCK: All station personnel are dead.
KIRK [OC]: What caused it?
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before.

Captain's Log: Stardate 1704.2. The science party we were to have picked up has been found dead. Life support systems had been turned off. Station personnel, frozen to death. Conditions highly unusual. Meanwhile, we remain in orbit to complete our mission, close scientific measurement of the break-up of this planet.

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: You received my signal, Mister Scott.
SCOTT: Yes, sir. Decontaminate.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Captain here.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Spock and Tormolen aboard, sir.

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: We're holding them in the chamber for decontamination.
KIRK: Better have Medicine look them over too. Tell Mister Spock I'll meet him there in ten minutes. Kirk out.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: You're fine, Joe. Up and out of there. Mister Spock? Your pulse is two hundred and forty two, your blood pressure is practically nonexistent, assuming you call that green stuff in your veins blood.
SPOCK: The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain.
KIRK: How are they?
MCCOY: They're fine, Jim.
TORMOLEN: Terrible, Captain. It was terrible. They were just sitting, like they didn't care. Whatever was happening, they didn't care. I keep wondering
KIRK: You keep wondering if man was meant to be out here. You keep wondering, you keep signing on. Any guesses, Mister Spock? Any idea of what happened down there?
SPOCK: I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something.
TORMOLEN: Six dead. Six people dead.
KIRK: You'd better get some rest.
TORMOLEN: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Set up those tapes, Mister Spock. We'll see if the answers are there. (leaves with Spock)
CHAPEL: The lab status report, Doctor.
MCCOY: Oh, thank you, Christine.

[Briefing room]

SPOCK: Next tape, please.
RAND: Spectro-analysis tape, sir.
SPOCK: Thank you.
KIRK: Almost as though they were irrational, drugged. An engineer sitting there, apparently oblivious to everything. A woman strangled. A crewman with a phaser pistol in his hand.
SPOCK: He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.
KIRK: And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower. If the image wasn't so ugly, it would be laughable. Not even a theory, gentlemen?
MCCOY: Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The bio-analysis on the tapes prove that conclusively.
SPOCK: It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no contamination, no unusual elements present.
SCOTT: Or at least none your tricorders could register.
SPOCK: Instruments register only those things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.
KIRK: Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the breakup of this planet. To do this, we need the Enterprise in a critically tight orbit. Question. Could what happened down there to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew?
SPOCK: We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit. When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity, mass, magnetic field.
KIRK: The purpose of a briefing, gentlemen, is to get me answers based on your abilities and experience. In a critical orbit, there's no time for surprise.
SCOTT: Unless you people on the Bridge start taking showers with your clothes on, my engines can pull us out of anything. We'll be warping out of orbit within a half second of getting your command.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain.
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: Scanners report sudden four degree shift in planet magnetic field. A change in mass also, sir.
SPOCK: It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.
KIRK: On our way, Lieutenant. I'll hold you to that half second, Scotty.

[Rec room]

SULU: Foil. It's a rapier. A thin sword.
RILEY: All right. So what do you do with it?
SULU: What do you mean, what do you do with it?
RILEY: Self-defence? Mayhem? Shish kebab?
SULU: You practice.
RILEY: For what?
SULU: Hi, Joey.
RILEY: Last week it was botany he was trying to get me interested in. I was supposed to be collecting leaves, plant specimens.
SULU: Your attitude is all wrong. Fencing tones the muscle, sharpens the eye, improves the posture. You tell him, Joey. Explain to him. Hey, Joey. You feeling all right?
TORMOLEN: Get off me! You don't rank me and you don't have pointed ears, so just get off my neck!
SULU: What's with him?
TORMOLEN: Nothing!
UHURA [OC]: Attention. Engine room on standby alert. All duty personnel to the Bridge. Acknowledge.
SULU: You sure you're all right now, Joe? We've got to leave.
TORMOLEN: We're all a bunch of hypocrites. Sticking our noses into something that we've got no business. What are we doing out here, anyway?
SULU: Take it easy, Joe.
TORMOLEN: We bring pain and trouble with us, leave men and women stuck out on freezing planets until they die. What are we doing out here in space? Good? What good? We're polluting it, destroying it. We've got no business being out here. No business.
RILEY: Take it easy, Joe.
SULU: Now calm down.
TORMOLEN: If a man was supposed to fly, he'd have wings. If he was supposed to be out in space, he wouldn't need air to breathe, wouldn't need life-support systems to keep him from freezing to death.
RILEY: Hey, Joey, put the knife down, huh?
SULU: You're all steamed up, Joe.
TORMOLEN: We don't belong here. It's not ours. Not ours. Destroying and watching. We don't belong. I don't belong. Six people died down there. Why do I deserve to live?
SULU: What are you doing, Joe?
RILEY: Hey, Joey, put the knife down. (grabs his arm) Don't be a fool.
TORMOLEN: Let go!
RILEY: You're just getting in a sweat about (three men struggle) Let me have the knife!
SULU: Joey, don't be a fool.
TORMOLEN: Let me go.
RILEY: Joey, give me the knife. (they fall to the floor, Tormolen gets stabbed in the stomach) Emergency! Rec room, area three nine. We need medics!

Captain's Log, supplemental. Our orbit tightening. Our need for efficiency, critical. But unknown to us, a totally new and unusual disease has been brought aboard.

[Bridge]

RILEY: Relative gravity increasing, sir.
KIRK: Compensate, Mister Riley.
RILEY: Yes, sir.
SULU: Magnetic field continuing to shift, sir. Planet continuing to shrink in mass.
KIRK: Mister Spock?
SPOCK: All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain.
RILEY: Orbit steady now, sir.
SPOCK: Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected. A valuable study. We may be seeing Earth's distant future. Before its sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours.
SULU: Helm answering nicely, Captain.
KIRK: Good.
UHURA: Communications status, Captain.
KIRK: Tormolen's record?
SPOCK: Psychiatric file, personality quotients.
KIRK: Was he trying to kill himself?
SPOCK: It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured.
KIRK: Doesn't sound like the man I know.
SPOCK: His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.

[Sickbay]

CHAPEL: His breathing rate is dropping, Doctor.
MCCOY: Compensate with the respirator. Stand by to close. Closing.

[Bridge]

KIRK: What is it?
SULU: Relative gravity increase, sir. Like the planet reached out and yanked at us.
KIRK: Compensate. (adjusts Riley's controls) Compensate.
RILEY: Orbit steady now, sir. May be a little nervous, I guess.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: This shouldn't be happening. This man should be getting stronger. You sure the respirator's functioning properly?
CHAPEL: Yes, Doctor.
MCCOY: Why is this man dying? Hypo.
CHAPEL: He's dead, Doctor.
MCCOY: The wounds were not that severe.

[Bridge]

MCCOY [OC]: This is McCoy. Captain Kirk to Sickbay.
KIRK: Uhura, monitor communications. Tell McCoy I'll be there when I can.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface moves away from us.
KIRK: Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it.
SPOCK: Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden change.
KIRK: Engine room from Bridge.
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, Captain.
KIRK: Tie into the helm, Scotty. If we should call for power, we'll want it fast.
SCOTT [OC]: No problem, sir. You'll have it.
SPOCK: Rate of compaction seems constant.
KIRK: Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants. Keep me informed of any change, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Acknowledged.
SULU: Don't know if it's this planet or what happened with Joe. I'm sweating like a bridegroom.
RILEY: Yeah, me too.
SULU: Hey, why don't you come down to the gym with me, Kevin m'lad?
RILEY: Now?
SULU: Why not? Light workout will take the edge off.
RILEY: Sulu, what about. Hey, Sulu, don't be a fool!

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Intestinal damage wasn't that severe. I got to him in plenty of time. That man should still be alive. The only reason he died, Jim, is he didn't want to live. He gave up.
KIRK: That's a supposition, Doctor, not a fact.
MCCOY: Well, that may be. Maybe. I've lost patients before, but not like that. Not Joe's kind. That kind of man doesn't give up.
KIRK: Coincidence? Maybe.
MCCOY: You mean that Joe was down on the planet surface and you're gonna ask me if it's connected.
KIRK: That's exactly what I was going to ask.
MCCOY: Jim, he was decontaminated. He's been medically checked. We've run every test we know for everything we know.
KIRK: That's not good enough.
MCCOY: Well, we're doing everything that's possible.
KIRK: Bones, I want the impossible checked out too.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?
RILEY: Magnetic pull compensated for, sir. Orbit steady.
SPOCK: Take over here, Rand. (a male, not Janice)
RAND: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?
RILEY: Have no fear, O'Riley's here. One Irishman is worth ten thousand of you
SPOCK: You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this station.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
RILEY: Now that's what I like. Let the women work too. Universal suffrage.
SPOCK: Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley.
RILEY: Sickbay? Exactly where I was heading, sir.
SPOCK: Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge.

[Sickbay]

RILEY: Where's Joe?
CHAPEL: Well.
RILEY: He died, didn't he.
CHAPEL: Yes.
RILEY: You know something? You have such lovely eyes, pretty lady. (touches her face)
CHAPEL: I know he was a friend of yours. This must be a terrible shock.
RILEY: You know what Joe's mistake was? He wasn't born an Irishman.

[Corridor]

SULU: (brandishing foil) Richelieu, beware! Stand. No farther. No escape for you. You either leave this bois bloodied, or with my blood on your swords. Cowards!

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura.
BRENT: Yes, sir.
KIRK: What were their symptoms?
SPOCK: Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed rather pleased with himself, as if he were
KIRK: Irrational, or drugged.
SPOCK: Precisely.
KIRK: Security, Lieutenant Uhura.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Both Sulu and Riley, locate and confine. I want every crewman who comes in contact with them medically checked.
UHURA: Sir, level two, corridor three reports a disturbance. Mister Sulu chasing crewmen with a sword.
KIRK: Put Security on it.
SPOCK: Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your 18th century.
KIRK: Present condition of Psi 2000.
SPOCK: Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position.
KIRK: Helmsman, stabilise position.
BRENT: Helm is not answering to control.
KIRK: Warp us out of here.
BRENT: No response from engines, sir.
KIRK: Impulse power then. Blast us out of this orbit.
BRENT: Impulse engines also dead, sir.
SPOCK: Engine room, we need power!
KIRK: Mister Scott, acknowledge. Our controls are dead. Take her.
SULU: Richelieu, at last.
KIRK: Sulu, put that (discovers that the point is sharp) put that thing away.
SULU: For honour, Queen, and France! (lunges)
UHURA: Sulu.
SULU: Ah.
UHURA: Sulu, give me that.
SULU: I'll protect you, fair maiden.
UHURA: Sorry, neither.
SULU: Foul Richelieu. (distracted by Uhura's escape, Kirk is able to grab Sulu and Spock does a neck-pinch)
KIRK: I'd like you to teach me that sometime.
SPOCK: Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
KIRK: Scotty, we need power. Engine room, acknowledge!
RILEY [OC]: You rang, sir?
KIRK: Who's this?

[Engineering]

RILEY: This is Captain Kevin Thomas Riley of the starship Enterprise.

[Bridge]

RILEY [OC]: And who is this?
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. Get out of the engine room, navigator. Where's Mister Scott?
RILEY [OC]: I've relieved Mister Scott of his duties. Now, attention, cooks. This is your captain speaking. I would like double portions of ice cream for the entire crew.
KIRK: Clear that tube, will you?
UHURA: Yes, sir.
RILEY [OC]: And now, your captain will render an ancient Irish favourite. (sings) I'll take you home again Kathleen
SPOCK: Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere.
KIRK: And burn up. I know, Mister Spock.
RILEY [OC]: Wild and wide to where your heart

Captain's Log, stardate 1704.4. Ship out of control, spiraling down towards planet Psi 2000. We have nineteen minutes of life left without engine power or helm control.

[Corridor outside Engineering]

KIRK: How did Riley get in there?
SCOTT: He ran in, said you wanted us on the Bridge.
KIRK: He's cut off both helm and power.
SCOTT: And he shut the door behind us and locked off the mechanism.
KIRK: Can't you get to the auxiliary?
SCOTT: I can't. He's hooked everything through the main panel in there. Get up to my office and pull the plans for this bulkhead. The only way to get that door open is to cut through these wall circuits here.

[Engineering]

RILEY: (singing) The roses all have left your cheeks. I've watched them fade away and die

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Status reports, all sections.
UHURA: Mister Spock, a fight in the aft wardroom. Security reports incidents among the crewmen are increasing.
SPOCK: Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.
UHURA: All decks, alert system B two. Repeat, go to alert condition Baker two. Seal off all main sections. Stand by.
SPOCK: We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is.
KIRK: Continue the alert, Lieutenant.
UHURA: I can't, sir. He's cut off the alert channels.

[Engineering]

RILEY: Lieutenant Uhura,

[Bridge]

RILEY [OC]: You've interrupted my song. I'm sorry, but there'll be no ice cream for you tonight.
KIRK: Cut him off.
UHURA: I can't, sir. There's no way to do it.
RILEY [OC]: Attention, crew. This is Captain Riley. There will be a formal dance in the bowling alley at nineteen hundred hours tonight.
SPOCK: No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir. (ship is jolted severely)
MCCOY: Sickbay to Bridge.
KIRK: Can you tie me in to the Sickbay?

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: I'm getting you, Jim. Look, can you keep this beast level? I've got Sulu tranquillized and we're running tests on him.

[Bridge]

MCCOY [OC]: So far there's nothing unusual in his bloodstream. Body functions seem normal.
KIRK: Riley's the immediate problem, Doctor. Is there any way, anything you can do to snap him out of it?

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Negative, until I can get a little farther on these tests.

[Bridge]

RILEY [OC]: This is Captain Riley. Crew, I have some additional orders.

[Engineering]

RILEY: In the future, all female crew members will wear their hair loosely, about their shoulders.

[Bridge]

RILEY [OC]: And use restraint in putting on your makeup. Women, women should not look made up. And now, crew, I will render Kathleen one more time!
KIRK: Please, not again.

[Engineering]

RILEY: (singing) I'll take you home again, Kathleen (meanwhile, Scott is working in a Jefferies tube) I've watched them fade away and die.

[Corridor]

SCOTT: I've set the jumpers up there. Stand by 'til I give you a signal.

[Engineering]

RILEY: And tears bedim your loving eyes. Oh,

[Corridor outside Engineering]

RILEY [OC]: I will take you home Kathleen.
SCOTT: Engineering to Bridge. Try your helm. You'll have enough power to keep her stabilised. Here, let's have a look at that.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've stabilised, but still spiraling down.
UHURA: Emergency signal, Captain. Both decks four and five. Fights and disorders.
KIRK: Get me Sickbay.
UHURA: I have no intercom for Sickbay. He keeps switching channels on me.
KIRK: See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy. Better check Scotty first. Move him faster. He's got to get through that bulkhead.

[Corridor] SPOCK: Crewman, report to the lab!
MOODY: (singing) I'll take you home again Janice
SPOCK: What's going on?
RAND: Mister Spock, I'm trying to get to the Bridge and this crewman won't let me by.
SPOCK: Crewman, stand aside.
MOODY: Oh, yes, sir. I'll take you home again, Janice
RAND: Spock!

[Corridor outside Engineering]

SPOCK: Message from the captain.
SCOTT: Tell him I'm doing my best. If I cut through the wrong circuits
SPOCK: We have fourteen minutes left.
SCOTT: Even if we were under a full-scale attack I couldn't move any faster, not and maintain a safety factor.
SPOCK: At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a safety factor.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Biopsy lab. Biopsy, where's my report? Biopsy, come in! Harrison, where's my report? I'm going to the lab.
CHAPEL: Sir?
MCCOY: Yes?
CHAPEL: The tranquillizer's wearing off.
MCCOY: Oh, good. I'll need him conscious now. Continue to examine him on circuits K one and three.
CHAPEL: Of course, Doctor.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Get him out of here.
RAND: I would have gotten here sooner, sir but Crewman Moody stopped me in the hallway.
KIRK: Take the helm.
RAND: Sir?
KIRK: Take the helm!
RAND: Yes, sir.
RILEY [OC]: Kathleen. And now, crew, one more time!
KIRK: At least try cutting him off!
UHURA: Sir, if I could cut him off, don't you think I
RILEY [OC]: I'll take you home again Kathleen
UHURA: Yes, sir. I'll keep trying.
KIRK: Sorry.
RILEY [OC]: Across the ocean wild and wide
KIRK: Scotty.
SCOTT [OC]: Engine room.
KIRK: We've got twelve minutes left. It'll take at least two or three of them to get the engines up to power now.
SCOTT [OC]: Then we'll make it, sir, if all goes right.
KIRK: Call me when you've cut through. I want to be there. Kirk out.

[Sickbay]

SPOCK: Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?
CHAPEL: He's gone to the lab.
SPOCK: Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!
CHAPEL: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: What is it, Nurse?
CHAPEL: Mister Spock, (takes his hand) the men from Vulcan treat their women strangely. At least, people say that, but you're part human too. I know you don't, you couldn't, hurt me, would you? I'm in love with you, Mister Spock. You, the human Mister Spock, the Vulcan Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Nurse, you should
CHAPEL: Christine, please. I see things, how honest you are. I know how you feel. You hide it, but you do have feeling. Oh, how we must hurt you, torture you.
SPOCK: I'm in control of my emotions.
CHAPEL: The others believe that. I don't. I love you. I don't know why, but I love you. I do love you just as you are. Oh, I love you.
SPOCK: I'm sorry.
UHURA [OC]: Captain is en route to Engineering, Mister Spock. Can you take the bridge? Acknowledge.
SPOCK: I am sorry.
CHAPEL: Christine.
SPOCK: Christine.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Sickbay. Is Mister Spock there?

[Corridor]

UHURA [OC]: Mister Spock, would you please acknowledge? (Spock is struggling to keep his control)

[Corridor outside Engineering]

RILEY [OC]: I will take you home Kathleen
SCOTT: Almost ready, sir.
RILEY [OC]: To where your heart will feel no pain. When the fields are fresh and green. I'll take you to your home
SCOTT: - Ready, sir.
KIRK: (to Security) Follow me through. Put your phasers on stun. Don't fire unless he's armed. Go.

[Engineering]

RILEY: I'll take. No dance tonight.
KIRK: Get him out of here.

[Briefing room]

SPOCK: (close to tears) I'm in control of my emotions. Control of my emotions. I am an officer. An officer. My duty. My duty is, is. My duty is to, to. Too late. I'm sorry. To. Two, four, six. Six. Six times six.

[Engineering]

KIRK: Scotty, we haven't got much time left.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain.
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: Entering planet's outer atmosphere, sir.
SCOTT: Captain.
KIRK: What is it?
SCOTT: He's turned the engines off. Completely cold. It will take thirty minutes to regenerate them.
UHURA [OC]: Ship's outer skin is beginning to heat, Captain. Orbit plot shows we have about eight minutes left.
KIRK: Scotty!
SCOTT: I can't change the laws of physics. I've got to have thirty minutes.

Captain's Log, supplemental. The Enterprise, spiraling down out of control. Ship's outer skin heating rapidly due to friction with planet atmosphere.

SCOTT: Maybe twenty two, twenty three minutes.
KIRK: Scotty, we've got six.
SCOTT: Captain, you can't mix matter and antimatter cold. We'd go up in the biggest explosion since
KIRK: We can balance our engines into a controlled implosion.
SCOTT: That's only a theory. It's never been done.
KIRK: Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?
SCOTT: If you wanted to chance odds of ten thousand to one, maybe, assuming we had a row of computers working weeks on the right formula.
UHURA: Mister Spock is not on the Bridge, Captain.

[Bridge]

SULU: (waking up screaming) I was on the Bridge. Hey Doc, what am I doing here?
MCCOY: McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum.
HARRISON [OC]: What, Doctor?
MCCOY: It's water. Somehow on this planet, water's changed to a complex chain of molecules.
HARRISON [OC]: What's that, Doctor?
MCCOY: That's how we missed it. It passed from man to man through perspiration. Once in the bloodstream, it acts like alcohol, depresses the centres of judgment, self-control. Now get someone to the lab. Tell them the serum works, and start preparing more.
SULU: Doc, will you let me out of here? I'm all right.
MCCOY: Release him.

[Briefing room]

SCOTT [OC]: Engineers, man your stations. Engine rooms, report. Cycling station, report. This will be an emergency restart of engines.
KIRK: Where have you been? What happened?
SPOCK: My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.
KIRK: We've got four minutes, maybe five.
SPOCK: An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad taste.
KIRK: We've got to risk a full-power start. The engines were shut off. No time to regenerate them. Do you hear me? We've got to risk a full-power start!
SPOCK: I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth blood. (Kirk slaps him) Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed.
KIRK: (hitting him repeatedly) You've got to hear me! We need a formula. We've got to risk implosion!
SPOCK: t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings. (finally hits Kirk back)
KIRK: We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance.
SPOCK: It's never been done.
KIRK: Don't tell me that again, Science Officer! It's a theory. It's possible. We may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun in these parts exploded, but we've got to take that one in ten thousand chance!
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain. Engineer asked, did you find
KIRK: Yes, I found Mister Spock! I'm talking to Mister Spock, do you understand?
UHURA: Yes, sir. Three and a half minutes left, Captain.
KIRK: I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and I'm better off without mine. This vessel, I give, she takes. She won't permit me my life. I've got to live hers.
SPOCK: Jim.
KIRK: I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock? You're allowed to notice her. The Captain's not permitted
SPOCK: Jim, there is an intermix formula.
KIRK: Now I know why it's called she.
SPOCK: It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between time and antimatter.
KIRK: Flesh woman to touch, to hold. A beach to walk on. A few days, no braid on my shoulder.
SCOTT: Captain.
KIRK: Scotty, help.
SPOCK: Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.
UHURA [OC]: Entering upper stratosphere, Captain. Skin temperature now twenty one hundred seventy degrees.
KIRK: I've got to hang on. Tell them. Clear the corridors, the turbo lift. Hurry. (Scott and Spock leave) Never lose you. Never.

[Turbolift]

KIRK: Bridge.

[Bridge]

(McCoy gives Kirk a hypo as he leaves the turbolift)
KIRK: Engine room. We're set. Hyperbolic course.
BRENT: Direction, sir?
KIRK: Direction. Direction. It doesn't matter. The way we came.
SULU: Course laid in, sir.

[Engineering]

SPOCK: Fuel temperature.
SCOTT: Level.

[Bridge]

KIRK: (gazing at Janice) No beach to walk on.
RAND: Sir?

[Engineering]

SPOCK: Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.
SCOTT: That'll take four minutes.
SPOCK: We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Engage.
SPOCK: Are you all right, Jim?
KIRK: Are you? (Spock nods)
MCCOY: We found a cure. We're over that part of it.
SPOCK: Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded.
SULU: Captain, my velocity gauge is off the scale.
SPOCK: Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling faster than is possible for normal space.
KIRK: Checked elapsed time, Mister Sulu.
SULU: My chronometer's running backwards, sir.
KIRK: Time warp. We're going backward in time. Helm, begin reversing power. Slowly.
SULU: Helm answering, sir. Power reversing.
SPOCK: We're back to normal time, Captain.
KIRK: Engines ahead. Warp one.
SULU: Warp one, sir.
KIRK: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
KIRK: The time warp. What did it do to us?
SPOCK: We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again.
KIRK: Not those last three days.
SPOCK: This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era.
KIRK: We may risk it someday, Mister Spock. Resume course to our next destination, Mister Sulu.
SULU: Course laid in, sir.
KIRK: Steady as she goes.
KIRK: That should make a good specimen.
SULU: (holding pink animal with a horn) Temperature's starting to drop.
KIRK: Yeah. At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero.
SULU: That's nippy.
FISHER: Hey!
KIRK: What happened?
FISHER: I fell off that bank, sir. Cut my hand.
KIRK: Let's see it. Get back to the ship. Report to the Sickbay.
FISHER: Yes, sir. Geological Technician Fisher. Ready to beam up.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Right. Locked onto you. Energise. Coadjutor engagement.
WILSON: What happened?
FISHER: I took a flop.
WILSON: Onto what?
FISHER: I don't know. Some kind of yellow ore.
SCOTT: Magnetic. Decontaminate that uniform.
FISHER: Yes, sir. (;eaves)
SCOTT: That acted like a burnout.
KIRK [OC]: Captain Kirk ready to beam up.
SCOTT: Just one moment, Captain. It checks out okay now. You better go get a synchronic meter so we can double-check.
WILSON: Yes sir.
SCOTT: All right, Captain. Locked onto you. (Kirk stumbles as he leaves the platform) Are you all right, Captain?
KIRK: Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy.
SCOTT: Let me give you a hand.
KIRK: I can't get through there. Nothing serious. Don't leave the transporter room unattended.
SCOTT: Wilson will be right back, sir.
(both leave, and another Kirk materialises on the pad)

Captain's Log, stardate 1672.1. Specimen-gathering mission on planet Alpha 177. Unknown to any of us during this time, a duplicate of me, some strange alter ego, had been created by the transporter malfunction.

[Transporter room]

WILSON: Captain? Are you all right, sir? Can I give you a hand, sir? Captain?

[Corridor]

UHURA [OC]: Bridge to all decks. Section duty officers, check communication lines.
KIRK: Thank you.
SCOTT: It might profit you to let Doctor McCoy give you the once-over.
KIRK: All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to.

[Kirk's quarters]

RAND: Ship's manifests, sir. I think they're in order now.
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman.
RAND: I've checked
KIRK: That's all.
RAND: Yes, sir. (leaves Kirk to lie down on bed)

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: You picked a good day, Fisher. Business has been lousy. What'd you do, take a fall on purpose so you could get a little vacation?
KIRK: Saurian brandy.
Back to duty status, Fisher. I have no sympathy for clumsiness.
FISHER: No, sir. The hand's much better, sir. (leaves)
MCCOY: What can I do for you, Jim?
KIRK: (grabbing him by the neck) I said, give me the brandy! (leaves with bottle and goes to Rand's quarters)

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK: Yeah.
SPOCK [OC]: Mister Spock.
KIRK: Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?
SPOCK: Is there something I can do for you, Captain?
KIRK: Like what?
SPOCK: Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you.
KIRK: That's nice. Come on, Spock, I know that look. What is it?
SPOCK: Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man, demanded brandy.
KIRK: Our good doctor's been putting you on again.
SPOCK: Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain, I'll get back to my work.
KIRK: I'll tell him you were properly annoyed.
SPOCK: Captain.

[Transporter room]

KIRK: What is it, Scotty?
SCOTT: Transporter breakdown. Continue circuit testing. We beamed up this animal and, well, look for yourself. It's in this specimen case. (opens lid to reveal angry pink animal)
KIRK: Yes?
SCOTT: A few seconds after they sent this one up through the transporter, that duplicate appeared. Except it's not a duplicate, it's an opposite. Two of the same animal, but different. One gentle, this. One mean and fierce, that. Some kind of savage, ferocious opposite. Captain, we don't dare send Mister Sulu and the landing party up. If this should happen to a man.
KIRK: Oh, my.

[Rand's quarters]

RAND: Oh! Captain, you startled me. Is there something that you? Can I help you, Captain?
KIRK: Jim will do here, Janice.
RAND: Oh.
KIRK: You're too beautiful to ignore. Too much woman. We've both been pretending too long. (grabs her) Stop pretending. Let's stop pretending. Come here, Janice. Don't fight me. Don't fight me, Janice. (kisses her)
RAND: Captain!
KIRK: Just a minute, Janice. Just a minute! (forces her onto the floor, she scratches his face and gets away to the door which opens just as Fisher is passing by)
RAND: Call Mister Spock! Call Mister Spock!

[Corridor]

FISHER: Geological Technician Fisher. Deck twelve, section (Kirk grabs him and hits him, hard)

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK: Me? My yeoman said that? I've been resting here since you left me. Alone, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay and left with it. I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters.
KIRK: Not true. I haven't been to the Sickbay. Let's find out what's going on.

[Turbolift]

KIRK: Sickbay. (just missing the other Kirk nursing grazed knuckles, who goes into his quarters)

[Sickbay]

RAND: Then he kissed me and he said that we, that he was the Captain and he could order me. I didn't know what to do. When you mentioned the feelings we'd been hiding, and you started talking about us.
KIRK: Us?
RAND: Well, he is the captain. I couldn't just. You started hurting me. I had to fight you, and scratch your face.
KIRK: Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any scratches?
RAND: I was sure I scratched you. I was frightened. Maybe
KIRK: Yeoman. I was in my room. It wasn't me.
RAND: Sir, Fisher saw you, too.
KIRK: Fisher saw?
RAND: If it hadn't been. I can understand. I don't want to get you into trouble. I wouldn't have even mentioned it!
KIRK: It wasn't me!
FISHER: It was you, sir.
KIRK: Do you know what you're saying?
FISHER: Yes, I know what I'm saying.
MCCOY: Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go.
SPOCK: You can go now, Yeoman. (Rand leaves) There's only one logical answer. We have an impostor aboard.

Captain's Log, stardate 1672.9. On the planet's surface, temperatures are beginning to drop, our landing party there in growing jeopardy. Due to the malfunction of the ship's transporter, an unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists.

[Transporter room]

KIRK: How did all this happen?
SCOTT: I don't know sir, but when Fisher came up, his suit was covered with a soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties. It may have caused an overload. Can't tell, not yet.
KIRK: Does the transporter work at all?
SCOTT: Yes sir, but we don't dare bring up the landing party. It might be duplicated like this animal.
KIRK: How long will it take you to find the trouble?
SCOTT: Can't say, sir.
KIRK: We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark. They'll die. The surface temperature of that planet goes down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero at night.
SCOTT: We're doing everything we can, sir.
KIRK: Yes, I know, Scotty.
SPOCK: About your double, Captain.
KIRK: Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister Spock. Organise search parties.
SPOCK: We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you.
KIRK: Yes, that's right. We don't know, but the men have to be armed. The men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, I repeat, locked, on setting number one. There can't be any chance of him being killed. He's to be taken without. If the men are forced to fire, he can't be killed.
SPOCK: How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are to capture you?
KIRK: Tell them.
SPOCK: The search parties, Captain.
KIRK: Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened. It's a good crew. They deserve to know.
SPOCK: Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew. You can't afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect. If you do, they lose faith, and you lose command.
KIRK: Yes, I do know that, Mister Spock. What I don't know is why I forgot that just now. Mister Spock, if you see me slipping again, your orders, your orders are to tell me.
SPOCK: Understood, Captain.

Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Something has happened to me. Somehow, in being duplicated, I have lost my strength of will. Decisions are becoming more and more difficult.

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK [OC]: This is the Captain speaking. There's an impostor aboard the ship, a man who looks exactly like me and is pretending to be me. This man is dangerous. Utmost caution is to be observed. All crew members are to arm themselves. The impostor may be identified by scratches on his face. Repeat, the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Section chiefs, assign personnel to the search. All search parties

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK [OC]: report to Mister Spock for assignment.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Something?
SPOCK: About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and locked.
KIRK: Oh, yes, yes. All hand phasers must be set on base cycle, stunning force.

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK [OC]: The impostor is not to be injured. Use minimum force. Repeat, the imposter
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk!
KIRK [OC]: Is not to be injured.
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! (goes to mirror, covers scratches with makeup, opens door) Wilson!
WILSON: Sir?
KIRK: Wilson, give me your phaser.
WILSON: Yes, sir.
KIRK: How have you been?
WILSON: Fine, sir. (Kirk grabs and hits him)

[Planet surface]

KIRK [OC]: How's it going down there, Mister Sulu?
SULU: It's already twenty degrees below zero. Can't exactly

[Briefing room]

SULU [OC]: call it balmy.
KIRK: Isn't there any way we can help them?
SPOCK: Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They won't operate.
KIRK: Then we've got to get those men up.
CREWMAN [OC]: Mister Spock?
SPOCK: Spock here.
CREWMAN [OC]: Transporter Technician Wilson found injured near the Captain's cabin. He says the impostor attacked him, called him by name, took his hand phaser.
SPOCK: Acknowledged. Continue the search.
KIRK: We've got to find him before he, but how?
SPOCK: Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search?
KIRK: The lower levels. The Engineering deck.

[Engineering]

SPOCK: Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to kill. What about your phaser, Captain? Don't you think we ought to get some help, Captain?
KIRK: No. I don't want anyone else to see the
SPOCK: Captain, you ordered me to tell you.
KIRK: Mister Spock, if I'm to be the Captain, I've got to act like one.
(they split up to search, and Kirk comes face to face with himself)
KIRK: You can't hurt me. You can't kill me. You can't. Don't you understand? I'm part of you. You need me. I need you.
OTHER KIRK: I don't need you. (Spock neck-pinches him, and his phaser fire hits a panel instead)

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, I don't think I dare give him a tranquilizer of any kind. I think we'd better bind him.
KIRK: Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me?
SPOCK: Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the power of decision.
MCCOY: You have a point, Spock?
SPOCK: Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, love, tenderness.
MCCOY: It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that, Spock?
SPOCK: Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you.
KIRK: What is your point, Mister Spock?
SPOCK: If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that.
MCCOY: You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that!
KIRK: For how long?
SPOCK: If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain, understand it's the way I am.
SCOTT [OC]: Captain Kirk.
KIRK: Kirk here.
SCOTT [OC]: Mister Scott, sir, on the lower level of the Engineering deck.

[Engineering]

SCOTT: I've found a new trouble with the transporter. The casing has a wide gap ripped in it. (the phaser damage) The main circuits

[Sickbay]

SCOTT [OC]: have been burned through. The abort control circuit is gone altogether.

[Planet surface]

SULU: Can you give us a status report, Captain? Temperature's still dropping. Now forty one degrees below zero.
KIRK [OC]: We've located the trouble. It shouldn't be much longer.
SULU: Do you think you might be able to find a long rope somewhere and lower us down a pot of hot coffee?

[Sickbay]

KIRK: I'll see what we can do.
SULU [OC]: Rice wine will do, if you're short on coffee.
KIRK: Engineering deck, Kirk here.
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, Captain.
KIRK: That unit, Scotty, status report.
SCOTT [OC]: The transporter unit ioniser. Nothing much left of it, sir.
KIRK: How bad is it?
SCOTT [OC]: We can't repair it in less than a week.

Captain's Log, stardate 1673.5. Transporter still inoperable. My negative self is under restraint in Sickbay. My own indecisiveness growing. My force of will steadily weakening. On the planet, condition critical. Surface temperature is seventy five degrees below zero, still dropping.

[Planet surface]

SULU: (using phaser to heat rocks) I think we ought to give room service another call. That coffee's taking too long. Enterprise, this is Sulu.

[Briefing room]

KIRK: Kirk here, Mister Sulu.
SULU [OC]: Hot line direct to the Captain. Are we that far gone?
KIRK: I gave everybody the afternoon off. I'm watching the store.

[Planet surface]

KIRK [OC]: How is it down there?
SULU: Oh, lovely, except that the frost is building up. We're using hand phasers to heat the rocks. One phaser quit on us, three still operating. Any possibility of getting us back aboard before the skiing season opens down here?

[Briefing room]

SPOCK: This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to hold on a little longer. There's no other way. Survival procedures, Mister Sulu.
SULU [OC]: Per your training programme, Mister Spock.

[Sickbay]

(other Kirk is screaming)
KIRK: What happened?
MCCOY: Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process. A fact I failed to consider.
KIRK: He's not dying?
KIRK: Yes, he is.
OTHER KIRK: Help me.
KIRK: How can he die? Can I survive without him?
MCCOY: I don't know, Jim.
KIRK: Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be afraid. I won't let go. Hold on. You won't be afraid if you use your mind and think! Think! You can do it. That's it!
MCCOY: Jim, he is back! Jim, you can use that brandy now. In fact, I'll join you.
KIRK: I have to take him back inside myself. I can't survive without him. I don't want him back. He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me. Me.
MCCOY: Jim, you're no different than anyone else. We all have our darker side. We need it! It's half of what we are. It's not really ugly, it's human.
KIRK: Human.
MCCOY: Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right. Without the negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain. You couldn't be, and you know it. Your strength of command lies mostly in him.
KIRK: What do I have?
MCCOY: You have the goodness.
KIRK: Not enough. I have a ship to command.
MCCOY: The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. For you see, he was afraid and you weren't.
SPOCK [OC]: Captain Kirk.
KIRK: Kirk here.
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. Would you come to the transporter room. We think we may have found an answer.
KIRK: Coming.

[Transporter room]

KIRK: What is it?
SCOTT: We've found a way to get the transporter working, sir.
SPOCK: We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest we send the animal through. Captain.
KIRK: Yes, yes. Go ahead.
SCOTT: (opening box with angry animal in it) I'll grab him by the scruff of the neck and hold him as long as I can.
KIRK: Don't hurt him.
SPOCK: It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes. (sedates it)
SCOTT: If this doesn't work, I don't know what will.
SPOCK: Energise. Reverse.
SPOCK: The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him.
MCCOY: He's dead, Jim.

Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Entry made by Second Officer Spock. Captain Kirk retains command of this vessel, but his force of will rapidly fading. Condition of landing party critical. Transporter unit still under repair.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know. Animal could have died of some kind of shock.
SPOCK: For once, I agree with you.
MCCOY: I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a full post-mortem.
SPOCK: No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror.
KIRK: Yes, yes, that sounds likely.
SPOCK: It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence controlling your fear.
KIRK: Get the transporter room ready.
MCCOY: Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the transporter circuits again.
KIRK: That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check everything.
SPOCK: Aren't you forgetting something, Captain?
KIRK: No, I don't think I've for
SPOCK: Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left?
KIRK: Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones. Their lives
MCCOY: Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction. Then you'd die. They'd die, anyway. Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory!
SPOCK: Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well.
KIRK: Help me. Somebody make the decision.
SPOCK: Are you relinquishing your command, Captain?
KIRK: No. No, I'm not.
MCCOY: Well then, we can't help you, Jim. The decision is yours.
KIRK: Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the autopsy.
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk, I have a tie-in with Sulu now.
KIRK: Kirk here.

[Planet surface]

SULU: Captain K-Kirk, Sulu here. One hundred seventeen below. Can't last much longer.

[Sickbay]

SULU [OC]: Can't see clearly, Doctor, to read top indicator. Think the cold penetrating communicator. Two men unconscious. No time. No. Can't wait. No time.
KIRK: Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu. Can't wait. Can't let them die.
OTHER KIRK: What are you going to do?
KIRK: Go through the transporter, both of us.
OTHER KIRK: There's nothing I can do to stop you.
KIRK: It's what I have to do. It's what I have to do. What we have to do.
OTHER KIRK: I won't fight you anymore. Oh, I feel so weak. I'll be glad when this is over. (grabs Kirk and knocks him out)

[Corridor]

KIRK: Janice, hello.
RAND: Captain, I
KIRK: Yeoman, I owe you an explanation.
RAND: No.
KIRK: Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate. The animal part of me came to your cabin. He even scratched me to make us look more alike. I'd like the chance to explain it to you. You don't mind if I come to your cabin later?
RAND: No, sir.
KIRK: (enters turbolift) Bridge.

[Bridge]

FARRELL: No word from Mister Sulu, sir.
OTHER KIRK: Prepare to leave orbit, Mister Farrell. Well?
FARRELL: Captain!
OTHER KIRK: I gave you an order, Mister Farrell.
FARRELL: But what about
OTHER KIRK: They can't be saved. Prepare to leave orbit.
FARRELL: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: Captain, I thought the plan
OTHER KIRK: I've changed my mind. Man your station, Mister Spock. (McCoy enters with another Kirk, identically dressed) Grab him. He's the impostor.
MCCOY: No!
OTHER KIRK: McCoy, he's fooled you.
MCCOY: He (the one in the captain's chair) attacked him.
OTHER KIRK: Mister Spock, you know who I am. You know what that is.
FARRELL: Mister Spock, which one? What do we do?
SPOCK: We'll let the captain handle this.
OTHER KIRK: I'm the captain. Isn't that obvious? Look at his face. Remember the scratches? Look how he's tried to hide them. He wants you to think that he's Captain Kirk. You know who I am.
KIRK: Yes, I know.
OTHER KIRK: You want to kill me, don't you? Farrell, James, grab him. He'll destroy the ship! I'm the Captain. Don't you understand? I'm captain of the ship! (starts attacking the crew) I'm the captain! This is my ship! My ship! It's mine! I'll kill you.
KIRK: Can half a man live?
OTHER KIRK: Take another step, you'll die.
KIRK: Then we'll both die.
OTHER KIRK: Please, I don't want to. Don't make me. Don't make me. (Kirk takes phaser off him) I don't want to go back. Please! I want to live!
KIRK: You will. Both of us.
OTHER KIRK: I want to live!

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: You'll have to hold on to him, Captain.
KIRK: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Captain?
KIRK: If this doesn't work.
SPOCK: Understood, Captain.
KIRK: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Ready. (beams them out)
MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock? (one figure is beamed back) Jim?
KIRK: Get those men aboard fast.
SPOCK: Right away, Captain.
MCCOY: (as the party is wheeled away) Severe exposure and frostbite, but I think they'll make it. How do you feel, Jim?
KIRK: How? I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.

[Bridge]

FARRELL: Status report, green.
SPOCK: All sections report ready, sir.
KIRK: Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us.
SPOCK: Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir?
KIRK: The impostor's back where he belongs. Let's forget him.
RAND: Captain? The impostor told me what happened, who he really was, and I'd just like to say that. Well, sir, what I'd like is
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman.
SPOCK: The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you say, Yeoman?
KIRK: This is the Captain speaking. Navigator, set in course correction. Helmsman, steady as she goes.
SULU: There he is, sir. Centre screen. Still trying to run away from us, sir.
KIRK: Don't lose him, Mister Sulu.
SULU: No, sir.
KIRK: Earth ship, Mister Spock?
SPOCK: Difficult to say, Captain. We're getting no registration beam from it.
SCOTT: If it is, he'll soon overload his engines.
SPOCK: Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard.
SULU: Changing course again. He knows we're after him all right.
KIRK: Stay with him, Mister Sulu. Communication?
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies, sir. He refuses to answer. Unless he's not receiving us.
KIRK: He's receiving us alright.
SPOCK: Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain. Schiller rating three five.
KIRK: Deflectors on, Mister Farrell.
SULU: He's seen the asteroids too, sir.
KIRK: Stay with him. He'll try to lose us in them.
SULU: If one hits him.
SPOCK: Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating.
KIRK: Try to warn him. If he loses power now
FARRELL: There go his engines, sir.
SULU: He's drifting into the asteroid belt, Captain.
FARRELL: He's had it, unless we put our deflector screen around him.
SCOTT: Captain, if we try, we'll overload our own engines. He's too far away.
KIRK: Cover him with our deflector screen, Mister Farrell. Scotty, Spock, stand by in the transporter room.
SCOTT: Aye, sir. (they leave)
FARRELL: We're protecting him, sir. We won't be able to hold it long.
SULU: We're overloading, Captain. Engine temperatures climbing.
CREWMAN [OC]: This is the Engine room. Temperatures are passing the danger line.
FARRELL Our deflector screen's weakening, sir. We can't protect them much longer. (lights flicker)
SULU: That was one of our lithium crystal circuits, sir.
KIRK: Bridge to transporter room. If you don't start beaming that crew over soon
SCOTT [OC]: They're not answering our signal. There's nothing to lock onto.
SULU (lights go out again) Another circuit, sir.
UHURA: I'm getting a distress signal call from them, sir.
KIRK: Scotty, we're getting a distress signal.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: We're locked onto something, Captain.
MUDD: Meaning no ingratitude, gentlemen, but just where is it I find meself?
MCCOY: You're aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
MUDD: It's really a darn beautiful ship, isn't it? Really a beautiful ship. Oh, the name, gentlemen, is Walsh, Captain Leo Walsh.
SPOCK: How many more in your crew?
MUDD: Just a few more.
SCOTT: Your vessel's breaking up, man. If we don't get them over here right now
MUDD: We couldn't be sure you was a friendly vessel, now could we. Ah, but the three will be in position about by now.

[Bridge]

SULU: Another lithium circuit. Now supplementing with battery power, sir.
KIRK: Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard?
SCOTT [OC]: Only one, sir, but we've locked onto three more.

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: What's wrong?
SCOTT: I don't know, sir. With those three lithium crystals gone
SPOCK: It'll take longer on battery power.
MCCOY: Never trusted this.

[Bridge]

FARRELL: There she goes.
SULU: Asteroid hit him dead centre.

[Transporter room]

KIRK [OC]: Bridge to transporter room. Their vessel has been hit by an asteroid. It's gone. Did you get the crew off?
SCOTT: Not yet, sir, but we've hooked onto something. (three women beam in, the men are transfixed)
KIRK [OC]: Kirk to transporter room. Report.
MUDD: It's all right, darlings. We're in good hands.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Bridge to transporter room.
FARRELL: We're clearing the asteroid belt now, Captain.
KIRK: Deflector screen down, Mister Farrell. Save the power.

[Transporter room]

KIRK [OC]: Captain to transporter room. Are you reading me or not, Mister Scott? Bridge to transporter room. How many did we get off?
SCOTT: Oh, er, four in all, sir.
KIRK [OC]: If that captain can walk, I want him in my cabin immediately. Correction,

[Bridge]

KIRK: I want him there whether he can walk or not. Kirk out.

[Transporter room]

MUDD: That fellow sounded a mite upset, didn't he?
MCCOY: Yes. Yes, they are.
SPOCK: Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh? No other crewmen?
MUDD: Oh, no, that's everyone, all right, but so far as the ladies actually being the crew
SPOCK: You can explain that to the Captain. (the group leave)
MCCOY: Amen to that, Scotty.

[Corridor]

MUDD: Ah, sure, these starships are really something marvellous, but men will always be men no matter where they are. Eh, mister? You'll never take that out of them.

[Turbolift]

SPOCK: Deck twelve.
MUDD: You're part Vulcanian, aren't you. Ah well then, a pretty face doesn't affect you at all, does it. That is, unless you want it to. You can save it, girls. This type can turn himself off from any emotion.
EVE: I apologise for what he said, sir. He's used to buying and selling people.
MUDD: I'll handle the conversation, darling.

[Captain's quarters]

KIRK: Come.
SPOCK: The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain.
KIRK: Good. Now, if you don't mind telling
EVE: Hello.
KIRK: And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain?
MUDD: Well, no, Captain. This is me cargo.

Captain's log, Stardate 1329.1. We've taken aboard from unregistered transport vessel its captain and, and three unusual females. These women have a mysterious magnetic effect on the male members of my crew, including myself. Explanation unknown at present.

[Captain's quarters]

MUDD: Well, how the devil am I supposed to know this is a starship, Captain? Here I am with a cargo of young lovelies. A strange ship comes up alongside. Well. naturally I did my best to evade you. And starship Captain or no, you exceeded your authority when you drove me and mine into a shower of asteroids.
KIRK: Your name, please.
MUDD: Walsh. Leo Walsh. You destroyed me ship, Captain.
KIRK: Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions. Mister Spock will supply you with any legal information you may need for your defence.
MUDD: You're a hard-nosed one, Captain.
KIRK: And you're a liar, Mister Walsh. I think we both understand each other. Security! Escort Mister Walsh to his quarters. Confine him there.

[Bridge]

SULU: You're on duty, Johnny-o. Back to reality.
FARRELL: You can feel their eyes when they look at you, like something grabbing hold of you. Did you notice that?
SULU: I noticed. How I noticed. Come on, Johnny.
SCOTT: We've got trouble, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott.
SCOTT: One lithium crystal left, and that with a hairline split at the base.
SPOCK: Better rig a by-pass circuit.
SCOTT: Can't. We blew the whole converter assembly.
KIRK [OC]: Kirk here.
SPOCK: Needed on the bridge, Captain.

[Briefing room]

WOMEN: Harry! Where were you?
MUDD: Shh! Calm down now, darlings. Would you mind waiting outside?
SECURITY: Sorry, sir.
MUDD: Well, now, answer every question they put to you. Don't lie. Well, you've no need to, have you, and don't submit to a med. That is, being so healthy, they've no need for a medical exam, have they.
RUTH: What if they ask about
MUDD: They won't. Have you no place to go lads?
MAGDA: They'll notice we're different.
MUDD: No, no, no, they won't. Just let Leo take all the hard questions. Now don't be panicking, loves. We'll get to
EVE: Get where? We don't have a ship and we're headed the wrong way, Harry.
NUDD: Leo. Leo Walsh is me name, darling. Don't forget that. So lovely. Lovely, aren't they? If they only think lovely thoughts, if they smile, they'll come out right some which way, won't they? My personal guarantee on that.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: The entire ship's power is feeding through one lithium crystal.
KIRK: Well, switch to by-pass circuits.
SCOTT: We burned them all out when we super-heated. That jackass Walsh not only wrecked his vessel, but in saving his skin
KIRK: If it makes you feel better, Engineer, that's one jackass we're going to see skinned.
SCOTT: But it's frustrating. Almost a million gross tons of vessel depending on a hunk of crystal the size of my fist.
SPOCK: And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power through it.
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock?
SPOCK: There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12. High-grade ore, I've heard.
KIRK: Location and distance.
SPOCK: Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel.
KIRK: Make for Rigel 12, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Rigel 12, Mister Farrell. You have the course.

Captain's log, Stardate 1329.2. On board the U.S.S. Enterprise, a ship's hearing is being convened against the transport vessel's captain. I'm becoming concerned about the almost-hypnotic effect produced by the women.

[Briefing room]

KIRK: This hearing is convened. Stardate 1329.2, on board starship U.S.S. Enterprise. Formal hearings against transport captain Leo Walsh. Start computer.
SPOCK: State your name for the record.
MUDD: Leo Francis Walsh.
COMPUTER: Incorrect.
SPOCK: Your correct name.
MUDD: Gentlemen, surely you're not going to take the word of a soulless mechanical device over that of a real flesh and blood man.
SPOCK: State your correct name for the record.
MUDD: Harry Mudd.
COMPUTER: Incorrect.
MUDD: Harcourt Fenton Mudd.
SPOCK: Any past offenses, Mister Mudd?
MUDD: Of course not. Gentlemen, I'm simply an honest businessman.
COMPUTER: Incorrect.
MUDD: Blast that tin-plated pot.
COMPUTER: Full data coming on screen.
RUTH: If it can read our minds, too.
MUDD: It can't, darling. It can't. Just what's on the record.
COMPUTER: Offense record. Smuggling. Sentence suspended. Transport of stolen goods. Purchase of space vessel with counterfeit currency. Sentences, psychiatric treatment, effectiveness disputed.
KIRK: Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation.
MUDD: What? My tiny ship in this immense galaxy a menace to navigation?
KIRK: You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's license.
MUDD: Untrue! I have a master's ticket.
COMPUTER: Incorrect. Master's license revoked Stardate 1116.4.
MUDD: All right. Well, very simply, Leo Walsh, who was to be my captain on this trip, passed away suddenly. Well, I had no choice but to take out me ship me own self. I assumed Leo's name out of courtesy to him. In memoriam, as it were. A fine, fine man, alas, gone to his reward.
KIRK: Destination and purpose of journey?
MUDD: Planet Ophiuchus 3. Wiving settlers.
KIRK: Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what?
MUDD: I recruit wives for settlers, a difficult but satisfying task.
KIRK: Data on witnesses.
COMPUTER: No data.
KIRK: Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings?
COMPUTER: No decipherable reading on females. However, unusual reading on male board members. Detecting high respiration patterns, perspiration rate up, heartbeat rapid, blood pressure higher than normal.
KIRK: Er, that's sufficient. Strike that from the record.
MUDD: You see, gentlemen, just as I told you. Three lovely ladies destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men, to supply that warmth of a human touch that's so desperately needed. A wife, a home, a family. Gentlemen, I look upon this work as a sacred public trust. I've devoted me whole life to it.
COMPUTER: Incorrect.
MUDD: Well, I'm about to start devoting my entire life to it.
KIRK: Did these ladies come voluntarily?
MUDD: Well, of course! Now, for example, Ruthie here comes from a pelagic planet, sea ranchers. Magda there from the helium experimental station.
EVE: It's the same story for all of us, Captain. No men. Mine was a farm planet with automated machines for company and two brothers to cook for, mend their clothes, canal mud a foot thick on their boots every time they walked in.
MUDD: Fine, Evie. Fine.
EVE: It's not fine! We've got men willing to be our husbands waiting for us, and you're taking us in the opposite direction! Staring at us Iike we were Saturnius harem girls or something.
MUDD: That's enough, Evie.
KIRK: The only charges are against Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a vessel. Do you have any defence to offer?
MUDD: Only heaven's own truth, which I've just given you.
KIRK: The hearing is closed. Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal authorities at our earliest opportunity.
EVE: And what about us? What happens to us? Help us, please. All of us.
KIRK: Miss McHuron, if you don't mind
SCOTT: Our last crystal, sir. It's gone.
SULU: Captain Kirk, engineering section reports our entire life-support system is now on batteries.
KIRK: Mister Spock. Miss McHuron, would you mind. Mister Spock, will you contact the miners on Rigel 12? Notify them that we'll need the lithium crystals immediately upon arrival. (all officers leave)
MUDD: Oh, you beautiful galaxy! Oh, that heavenly universe! Well, girls, lithium miners. Don't you understand? Lonely, isolated, overworked, rich lithium miners! Girls, do you still want husbands, hmm? Evie, you won't be satisfied with a mere ship's captain. I'll get you a man who can buy you a whole planet. Maggie, you're going to be a countess. Ruth, I'll make you a duchess. And I, I'll be running this starship. Captain James Kirk, the next orders you're taking will be given by Harcourt Fenton Mudd!

Captain's log-- Stardate 1330.1. Position, fourteen hours out of Rigel 12. We're on auxiliary impulse engines. Fuel low, barely sufficient to achieve orbit over the planet. Lithium replacements are now imperative. The effect of Mudd's women on my crew continues to grow, still totally unexplained. Harry Mudd is confined to his quarters under guard.

[Sickbay]

RUTH: May I come in?
MCCOY: Why, yes, please do. By all means. Connors, are you finished?
RUTH: I was wondering what this place looked like. It's fascinating.
MCCOY: Would, Would you walk past my panel again, please?
RUTH: Your what?
MCCOY: My medical scanner.
RUTH: Oh, why? You're not giving me an examination, are you?
MCCOY: Oh no. I wouldn't trust my, my judgment, believe me. Just walk by, please. (scanner heart monitor activates) It's not supposed to do that.
RUTH: I wondered, will you be examining the miners on Rigel 12?
MCCOY: Yes, if they need it.
RUTH: You haven't asked yet? Are they in good health and all?
MCCOY: What? Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them.
RUTH: Oh. Three.
MCCOY: Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something radioactive, my dear?
RUTH: No. I'm just me.
MCCOY: I wonder what makes it do that.

[Kirk's quarters]

EVE: Captain? I hope you don't mind.
KIRK: As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do.
EVE: I was trying to take a walk, and I just, I just had to run in someplace. You see, all your men were looking at me, following me with their eyes.
KIRK: Yes. I'll have to talk to them about that. They, er, they don't do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the ladies with you, its, er
EVE: They're probably just lonely. I can understand loneliness.
KIRK: Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron
EVE: I, I suppose you understand it even more, having to run a huge ship like this with so much responsibility every minute and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you.
KIRK: Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is.
EVE: Hmm! I read once that a commander has to act like a paragon of virtue. I never met a paragon.
KIRK: Neither have I.
EVE: Well, of course not. No one is. But some people try to pretend. Do you, Captain?
KIRK: Miss McHuron, I don't
EVE: Oh, no! Oh, I just can't do it. I don't care what Harry Mudd says. I do like you, but I just can't go through with it. I hate this whole thing!

[Mudds's quarters]

MUDD: Just three? You're sure?
RUTH: Yes. The miners are healthy and fairly young.
MUDD: Later, dear, later. Magda, did you get to your communications man?
MAGDA: The head miner is named Ben Childress. The others are Gossett and Benton.
MUDD: And they've been there?
RUTH: Almost three years now, alone!
MUDD: Perfect. Perfect. Three of them and three lovely ladies has Harry Mudd. And lithium crystals, my dear, are worth three hundred times their weight in diamonds, thousands of times their weight in gold.
RUTH: But they'll be down there, and we'll be up here, circling a hundred miles above them.
MAGDA: And there's a guard outside your door, Harry. You can't get out of your cabin.
MUDD: No, my dears. After one more job for you, it won't be Harry Mudd that's trapped. It will be a gentleman named James T
EVE: I don't like you, and I'm not very happy with myself, either.
MUDD: Well, I'm not really surprised. I've seen you noticing the Captain.
EVE: We're supposed to notice them! Oh, oh Harry, I don't feel very good. I think it must be near the time.

[Bridge]

KIRK: I asked for a preorbital course, Mister Farrell.
FARRELL: Preorbital course locked in, sir.
KIRK: That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen. We're down to battery power, and we're low on that.
SCOTT: It'll get us to Rigel 12, sir, but it'll be a shaky orbit.
KIRK: Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals, Scotty. That's all we need.
SCOTT: I'll get you there.
KIRK: Ridiculous. What are we running here. Did you examine them? Did you examine Eve?
MCCOY: She refused.
KIRK: Well, come on, you're the doctor. What is it? Is it that we're tired, and they're beautiful? They are incredibly beautiful.
MCCOY: Are they, Jim? Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound, measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known? Or is it that they just, well, act beautiful. No. Strike that, strike that.
KIRK: What are they?
MCCOY: You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing?
KIRK: I asked you first.
MCCOY: No, an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my medical scanner from going beep!
KIRK: I don't follow you.
MCCOY: I don't either.

[Mudd's quarters]

MAGDA: Top space frequency of three nine. (hands over communicator)
MUDD: Rigel 12. Rigel 12.
CHILDRESS [OC]: This is Rigel 12. Come in, Enterprise.
MUDD: Well, this isn't exactly the Enterprise. My name is Harry Mudd. To whom have I the pleasure of speaking, sir?

[Bridge]

SULU: Power curve still dropping, Captain.
FARRELL: We'll make orbit, sir. A temporary one.
KIRK: Lay in. Computer?
SPOCK: We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours.
KIRK: More than enough time. Communications, have a representative of the Rigel 12 miners meet us here to discuss our needs. Beam him up first pass over their camp.
UHURA: Yes, sir.

[Mudd's quarters]

RUTH: Look what's happening. (hair lank, skin slightly lined) Look at my face.
MAGDA: Give us the pills.
RUTH: What if someone sees us like this?
EVE: You'll never find them, Harry, and if you do find them you know what they are. A cheat. If you care for someone, really care
MUDD: (ransacking drawers frantically) For whom, Evie? For Kirk? You'll find out that Ship's captains are already married, girl, to their vessels. You'd find out the first time you came between him and the ship. You'll see.
RUTH: I'm going back to what I was. Ugly.
MAGDA: I can't stand myself like this.
RUTH: Why did you hide them, Harry? Don't you trust us?
MUDD: I didn't hide them, girl. I put them in a safe place in case I was searched.
MADGA: Find the pill, Harry!
MUDD: Mattress! Yes, here! (Ruth and Magda devour them eagerly) Go on, Eve. Take it. It's not a cheat. It's a miracle for some man who can appreciate it and who needs it.

[Kirk's quarters]

SPOCK: Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful. Destroying them was a shame.
KIRK: Not at all, Mister Spock. The choice was burning this lithium crystal or the destruction of another man's ship. Come.
SECURITY: Sir. Mining Chief Childress and Mister Gossett.
KIRK: Good. Show them in. I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise. This is my science officer Mister Spock.
CHILDRESS: Let's get right to business. You want lithium crystals and we've got them.
KIRK: Fine. I'm authorised to pay an equitable price.
CHILDRESS: We're not sure they're for sale, Captain. We might prefer a swap.
KIRK: What did you have in mind?
CHILDRESS: Mudd's women.
GOSSETT: If we like them. We'd like to have a look at them first of course.
CHILDRESS: Right. Trot them out, Captain. Oh, and Harry Mudd. Either way, I've agreed to have him released. Charges dropped.
KIRK: (laughs) Is there anything else?
CHILDRESS: You've got no choice, Kirk. You beam a landing party down, and you won't find one blessed crystal.
KIRK: No deal. You're a long way out in space, gentlemen. You'll need medical help, cargo runs, starship protection. You want to consider those facts too?
MUDD: Come along, ladies, come along. You must be Ben Childress. Come on now, girls, come on.
RUTH: And you must be Herm Gossett.
GOSSETT: Yes, I reckon I am.
CHILDRESS: One thing I'll say for you, Mudd, you're not a liar. Ladies, you are welcome.
KIRK: It's still no deal.
SPOCK: Conserving batteries, sir. Half power.
MUDD: I'm told they have only three days of orbit left before they start spiraling in. I do hate to see you suffering such a situation, Captain, but truth is truth, and the sad fact is you will deal. Sooner or later, you'll have to.

Captain's log. Transporting down to surface of planet Rigel 12 to acquire replacement lithium crystals. Expect further difficulty from miners.

[Miner's camp]

KIRK: All right, Childress, you've won. Now I'll take the lithium crystals.
CHILDRESS: When I have the time, Kirk.
KIRK: Childress.
CHILDRESS: We're busy, Mister Kirk.
SPOCK: We don't have the time to spare, Captain.
KIRK: You got a better idea?
CHILDRESS: (to Eve) Blows like that all the time. You can get lost a dozen feet from your doorstep. The wind comes up sudden. Magnetic storm. That means the wind will really rip soon.
MAGDA: Dance with me.
CHILDRESS: Would you like to dance?
EVE: No, I (coughs) No. I'm sorry, I guess it must be the dust.
CHILDRESS: That's the way it is on Rigel all the time. (cuts in on Ruth instead)
GOSSETT: Hey.
BENTON: Go away.
GOSSETT: I'm cutting in.
BENTON: Not on me. (fight starts)
CHILDRESS: What's the matter with you?
EVE: Why don't you run a raffle and the loser gets me? (leaves)
CHILDRESS: You can't go out there. You'll get killed.
KIRK: Just have those crystals here when I get back.

[Planet surface]

KIRK: Eve! Eve!

Captain's log. Have transported aboard the Enterprise to implement search with infrared scanners and sensing system. Magnetic storms on the planet's surface are cutting down speed and efficiency of our equipment. Search now in progress for three hours, eighteen minutes.

[Bridge]

FARRELL: Traverse parallel three and four.
SULU: Checking, but not getting much.
SPOCK: The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain. Getting difficult to probe through it.
SCOTT: Captain, this is draining our batteries further. If we only had those crystals.
KIRK: But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way. Satisfied, Mister Scott?
UHURA: Losing communications with the miners, sir. Magnetic storm seems worse.
KIRK: Has Childress reported in yet?
UHURA: No, sir. He and the girl are still missing.
KIRK: Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left?
SCOTT: About five hours, sir.

Captain's log. Have expended all but forty three minutes of power. Ship's condition, critical. Search now in progress seven hours, thirty one minutes. Magnetic storms are easing.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Infrared reading. Check traverse three, grid zero four zero.
FARRELL: About eleven miles, bearing one two one from the mining company.
SULU: That's Ben Childress' quarters.
SPOCK: There's a heat unit operating in there. It could be a cookstove.
KIRK: Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room.
SPOCK: Mudd?
KIRK: The name of this game.

[Childress' quarters]

CHILDRESS: I had things where I wanted them.
EVE: I ate some of your food, so I paid with some chores.
CHILDRESS: And I do my own cooking. I've not laid a hand on you. Remember that.
EVE: Oh, the sound of male ego. You travel halfway across the galaxy, and it's still the same song. There. You going to eat or talk?
CHILDRESS: I guess I'm supposed to sit, taste, and roll my eyes. Ooh, female cooking again. I've tasted better, by my own hand.
EVE: Well you're tasting some of it now. I couldn't scrape three layers of your leavings out of that pan.
CHILDRESS: You find me a well, some decent water, then talk.
EVE: Well, why don't you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand blast it clean, or hadn't you thought about that?
CHILDRESS: (after hanging out the pots) It might work. That solitaire?
EVE: Double jack.
CHILDRESS: The red eight ought to go on the black nine.
EVE: Not in double jack.
CHILDRESS: You're not only plain as an old bucket, you're not even good company. What the devil happened to your looks, anyway?
EVE: I got tired of you. I slumped.
CHILDRESS: You heard what I said. You're homely! I've got enough in crystals already to buy queens by the gross! (Kirk and Mudd enter) I didn't touch her.
MUDD: Thank heaven you found her.
CHILDRESS: She's been bubbling with gratitude ever since.
KIRK: Sit down. Tell him. Tell him, Harry.
MUDD: Ah. Yes, well.
KIRK: The Venus drugs, Harry.
CHILDRESS: Venus drug? I've heard of it but, it's not just one of those stories?
KIRK: Oh, it exists, illegally.
MUDD: Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug.
EVE: Harmless!
MUDD: Well, what it does is give you more of whatever you have. Well, with men, it makes them more muscular. Women, rounder. Men, more aggressive. Women, more feminine, and
KIRK: He gave it to the women before you met them.
CHILDRESS: Does that mean the others? They really look like she does?
MUDD: Mister Childress, I
CHILDRESS: Is that what it means?
EVE: Yes, that's what it means!
CHILDRESS: What happened to my partners?
KIRK: They've left for their quarters during the storm, Childress. They're married. Subspace radio marriage. It was a fraud. They can get out of it.
MUDD: If they want to.
CHILDRESS: Why?
MUDD: You can't condemn the women.
CHILDRESS: I can! A man goes out and fights, almost dies. We all almost die. We should have, but we didn't. And now that we've got the good life in our hands, you bring us women for wives that
EVE: You don't want wives, you want this. This is what you want, Mister Childress. I hope you remember it and dream about it, because you can't have it. It's not real! (takes the pills) Is this the kind of wife you want, Ben? Not someone to help you, not a wife to cook and sew and cry and need, but this kind. Selfish, vain, useless. Is this what you really want? All right, then. Here it is.
KIRK: Quite a woman, eh, Childress?
CHILDRESS: A fake, pumped up by a drug.
KIRK: By herself. She took no drug.
EVE: I swallowed it.
KIRK: Coloured gelatin.
MUDD: Yes, they took away my drug and substituted that.
EVE: But that can't be.
KIRK: There's only one kind of woman.
MUDD: Or man, for that matter.
KIRK: You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to. I want those lithium crystals and I want them now. Enterprise, this is Kirk.
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain.
KIRK: Stand by. Do I beam down a search party?
CHILDRESS: No, the crystals are here, and you're welcome to them.
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. We're coming aboard with the lithium crystals.
SPOCK [OC]: How many coming, Captain?
CHILDRESS: Eve will stay, today at least. We, er, we want to talk.
KIRK: Eve?
EVE: You've got someone up there called the Enterprise.
KIRK: Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd.
MUDD: Don't you think you could possibly, by accident, arrange to leave me behind here? On this planet that would be punishment enough.
KIRK: I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness at your trial. If you think that'll help.
MUDD: They'll throw away the key.

[Bridge]

MCCOY: That must have been quite a talk you made down there. Ever try considering the patent medicine business?
KIRK: Why should I work your side of the street?
SPOCK: I'm happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode.
MCCOY: Smack right in the old heart. Oh, I'm sorry. In your case, it would be about here.
SPOCK: The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end.
FARRELL: Course plotted and all systems in operation.
SULU: Engines engaged. Helm answering.
FARRELL: Out of orbit, sir.
KIRK: Ahead full.
SULU: Ahead full, sir.
BERKELEY: Ready to beam down. Energise. Energise.
KIRK: Having trouble, gentlemen?
BERKELEY: I just don't understand the problem, sir.
KIRK: You're beaming cargo down to a penal colony, Mister Berkeley.
BERKELEY: Their security force field, sir.
KIRK: U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
WOMAN [OC]: Rehab colony. Come in.
KIRK: Request opening in your force field for beaming down of cargo.
WOMAN [OC]: Enterprise, affirmative. Our security cover is now open.
KIRK: Energise. Any incoming cargo?
BERKELEY: Just one item, sir. Some research material bound for the Central Bureau of Penology at Stockholm.
WOMAN [OC]: Tantalus cargo ready to beam up.
KIRK: Oh, Mister Berkeley, you might refamiliarise yourself with the manual on penal colony procedures.
BERKELEY: Immediately, sir.
KIRK: I think you can take the time to lock this up first.
BERKELEY: I'll get a vault assignment. (leaves. The box opens, a man climbs out and attacks the technician)

Captain's log, stardate 2715.1. Exchanged cargo with penal colony on Tantalus V. I've departed without going ashore.

[Bridge]

KIRK: I would like to have met Doctor Adams. Have you ever been to a penal colony since they started following his theories?
MCCOY: A cage is a cage, Jim.
KIRK: You're behind the times, Bones. They're more like resort colonies now.
UHURA: Message, Captain. Switching to speaker.
WOMAN [OC]: Tantalus colony to Enterprise. We are unable to locate one of our inmates. This is a potentially violent case. Possibly hidden in the box we beamed up to you. Repeat, unable to locate one of our inmates. This is a potentially violent case.
KIRK: Enterprise acknowledging. Stand by. Security alert three.
UHURA: Security alert, condition three. All sections go to alert condition three. We may have an intruder aboard.

[Corridor]

UHURA [OC]: Repeat, all sections to alert condition three. Intruder aboard.
SECURITY: (to intruder who has swapped overall with technician) Hey, you from Engineering! (runs) Bridge. Section C, deck fourteen.

[Bridge]

UHURA: Captain, section C deck fourteen, reporting trouble. Someone in Engineering uniform.
KIRK: Security control, this is the Bridge. Come in.
SPOCK: I have them, Captain. Closing off deck fourteen, search in progress.

[Corridor]

UHURA [OC]: Security alert, condition three. (intruder jumps one of the security men) Approximately six foot four male, early forties. Approach with caution. This man's extremely dangerous.

[Bridge]

UHURA: Repeat, approach with extreme caution. Bridge out.
SPOCK: Negative in the deck area, Captain. He may have gotten out. Expanding search to adjoining sections.
KIRK: Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
ADAMS [OC]: Tantalus colony. Adams here.
KIRK: Doctor Adams? This is Captain Kirk. It appears we may have an inmate of yours aboard the ship.
UHURA: Transporter crewman found unconscious, Captain. Cargo case open and empty.
KIRK: Make that definite, Doctor. He's aboard.
ADAMS [OC]: Terribly sorry, Captain. I take all the blame. Let me repeat, he's clever as well as extremely violent. Take all possible precautions.
KIRK: We'll keep you posted, Doctor. Kirk out.
SPOCK: Interesting. Your Earth people glorify organised violence for forty centuries, but you imprison those who employ it privately.
MCCOY: And, of course, your people found an answer.
SPOCK: We disposed of emotion, Doctor. Where there is no emotion there is no motive for violence.
GELDER: Where's the captain? Which one of you is the captain?
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk.
GELDER: My name is Van Gelder. I want asylum.
KIRK: At gunpoint?
GELDER: I want your promise first, your word that you won't take me back there, to Tantalus.
KIRK: No promises. Give me the weapon.
GELDER: No! No. No, I'm not going back! I'll disable your vessel first. You choose, Captain. I'll destroy your control panel.
(Gelder is distracted and Spock neck-pinches him)
KIRK: Take him to Sickbay. Reverse course. Head back for Tantalus colony.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Abnormal, of course, but it's not schizophrenia, tissue damage, or any condition I'm acquainted with, Jim. And you know after getting him here, it took almost a triple dose of sedative to put him under.
KIRK: Your report said he was quite talkative.
MCCOY: But not very informative. He claimed one thing, then he seemed to forget, and then he'd start to claim something else, but always with just the ring of truth in it. I'd sure like to study this one, Jim.
KIRK: Not our problem, Bones.
GELDER: You smart, button-pushing brass hat. Wash your hands of it. Is that your system? You're both quite sure of yourselves, aren't you? Quite expert. Take him back. Let someone else worry about him.
KIRK: What did you say your name was?
GELDER: My name? My name is Simon Van Gelder. (in great pain) I was the director of, director at the Tantalus colony.
MCCOY: You see what I mean?
GELDER: I was a graduate of, of. I was assistant to Doctor. I knew. I knew, but they've erased it.
MCCOY: Erased?
GELDER: Edited, adjusted, subverted me, but I won't forget! I won't forget! You, you're so blind ignorant. You believe I belong back there, don't you? Dead or alive. Well, I won't let you take me back. I'm not going! I'll die first! Do you hear? I'm not going! No! No! No.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Estimated arrival at Tantalus?
SPOCK: Fifty seven minutes, thirty seconds, Captain.
KIRK: What's so fascinating?
SPOCK: An identification tape from our ship's library on Doctor Simon Van Gelder.
KIRK: Doctor Van Gelder?
SPOCK: Doctor Van Gelder, Captain. No mistake. There's a full ID tape on him.
KIRK: Committed to Tantalus colony when?
SPOCK: Assigned there six months ago as Doctor Adams' associate.
KIRK: Ship to surface, Tantalus colony.
UHURA: Hailing frequency's open, sir.
KIRK: U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
WOMAN [OC]: Tantalus.
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. I'd like to speak to Doctor Adams.
WOMAN [OC]: Stand by, Enterprise.
ADAMS [OC]: Captain Kirk, Doctor Adams here.
KIRK: Doctor Adams, regarding your escaped man
ADAMS [OC]: Is Doctor Van Gelder all right? And your people, no injuries?
KIRK: No casualties, sir. This man is Doctor Simon Van Gelder?
ADAMS [OC]: Yes, of course. You're certain he's all right? We've been very concerned. In the violent state he's in
KIRK: No harm to him, sir. We thought you might enlighten us as to his condition.
ADAMS [OC]: He'd been doing some experimental work, Captain, an experimental beam we'd hoped might rehabilitate incorrigibles. Van Gelder felt he hadn't the moral right to expose another man to something he hadn't tried on his own person.
KIRK: Tragedy, Doctor.
MCCOY: Jim, that doesn't quite ring true.
KIRK: Er, Doctor Adams, please stand by. Explain.
MCCOY: I don't believe him. I can't explain it, but the more I study that patient
KIRK: You don't believe him, and you can't explain it. Bones, are you aware that in the last twenty years Doctor Adams has done more to revolutionise, to humanise prisons and the treatment of prisoners than all the rest of humanity had done in forty centuries? I've been to those penal colonies since they've begun following his methods, and they're not cages anymore.
MCCOY: Jim
KIRK: They're clean, decent hospitals for sick minds.
MCCOY: Jim, listen!
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I suggest you ask Doctor Adams if he wants Van Gelder returned.
KIRK: Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder.
ADAMS [OC]: Yes, Captain. May I inquire about your patrol destinations? Are you passing near any hospital facilities superior to ours? I'd like Van Gelder to have the best possible treatment, of course.
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor. I'll take it up with the ship's surgeon. Stand by. Well, Bones, you've got the ball. You care to recommend a better place?
MCCOY: There are no superior facilities, he knows that. But that's not the question. If something unusual is going on down there
KIRK: An assumption, Doctor.
MCCOY: I'm required to enter any reasonable doubts into my medical log. That requires you to answer in your log. Sorry, Jim.
KIRK: Doctor Adams, this is rather embarrassing. By strict interpretation of our starship regulation, I'm required to initiate an investigation of this so that a proper report
ADAMS [OC]: No need to apologise, Captain Kirk. In fact, I'd take it as a personal favour if you'd beam down and look into it yourself. I'm sure you realise we don't get too many visitors here. Oh, I, er, Captain, I would appreciate it if you could come down with a minimum staff. We're forced to limit outside contact as much as possible.
KIRK: Affirmative, Doctor. I've visited rehab colonies before. Enterprise out. Find me someone in your department with psychiatric and penology experience, if possible.
MCCOY: Yes, sir.

Captain's log, stardate 2715.2. Standard orbit, planet Tantalus V.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Mission, routine investigation and report as per ship surgeon's medical log. As for my last entry, it seems I will get to meet Doctor Adams at last. However, I would have preferred other circumstances. Sickbay. Report, Doctor.
MCCOY [on monitor]: Van Gelder's still violently agitated, Captain.
KIRK: And you'd prefer to keep him here until I complete my investigation anyway.
SPOCK: I believe we should, Jim.
MCCOY [on monitor]: Oh, I'm assigning your technical aide, Captain. One of our psychiatrists does have a background in rehabilitative therapy. Doctor Noel, standing by in the transporter room now.
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor. Bridge out. Mister Spock.

[Transporter room]

KIRK: Co-ordinates?
BERKELEY: Locked in, sir. Ready to beam down.
NOEL: Doctor Helen Noel, Captain. We've met. Don't you remember the science lab Christmas party?
KIRK: Yes, I remember.
NOEL: You dropped in
KIRK: Yes, yes, I remember.
SPOCK: Problem, Captain?
KIRK: Mister Spock, you tell McCoy that she had better check out as the best assistant I ever had. Energise.
BERKELEY: Energise.

[Building entrance]

KIRK: In here, I presume, Doctor.
NOEL: Perhaps it would be simpler if you called me Helen, Captain, since
KIRK: This is another time, another place, and another situation.
NOEL: Of course, Captain.

[Turbolift]

KIRK: Elevator, and going down quite a ways.
NOEL: (in his arms) I wouldn't recommend it for weak hearts.

[Adam's study]

ADAMS: Hello Captain Kirk, and er
KIRK: Doctor Helen Noel. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, sir.
ADAMS: Thank you. Thank you, Captain. Welcome to Devil's Island, Doctor.
NOEL: Perhaps you'll call me Helen, Doctor. With so many titles around, we're not going to be sure who's talking to who.
ADAMS: I shall indeed. Won't you?
NOEL: Thank you.
KIRK: I believe regulations call for me to check my weapon.
ADAMS: No, no. That won't be necessary in your case, Captain. Just keep it out of sight, hmm? I know you people feel as naked without a weapon as we do without a medikit. A small toast. Do you mind? It's such a great day for us here on Tantalus when we have visitors, no matter what the excuse.
KIRK: Doctor.
ADAMS: Oh, now, Captain, you made your apology from upstairs. Now forget it. I don't think you'll be able to get through the security screen, Captain. Just a second, hmm? There. Now try it.
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
SPOCK [OC]: Enterprise. Spock here.
KIRK: Your landing co-ordinates were right on the nose, Mister Spock. We arrived safely, and we're here with Doctor Adams right now. Kirk out.
SPOCK [OC]: Affirmative, Captain. Enterprise out.
ADAMS: Ah, Lethe, come in. Lethe, this is Captain Kirk and Doctor Helen Noel. Lethe came to us for rehabilitation and stayed on as a therapist, and a very good one too, I might add.
LETHE: I love my work.
ADAMS: Go right ahead, Captain.
KIRK: Before you came here
LETHE: I was another person, malignant, hateful.
KIRK: May I ask what crime you committed?
LETHE: Does it matter? That person no longer exists.
ADAMS: Um, part of our cure, if you will, Captain, is to bury the past. Why should a person go on living with unbearable memories if there's no necess. Oh, I feel quite sure that you'd concur with me in that, Doctor. Helen.
NOEL: A shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy.
ADAMS: Yes. And now to the toast, hmm? You'll forgive us, Lethe. There you are, Captain. To all mankind. May we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that, that we cannot fill them with love and warmth.

[Corridor]

KIRK: Quite a tour, Doctor. Very impressive.
ADAMS: Thank you. Hi, Carl.

[Treatment room]

KIRK: Doctor.
ADAMS: Yes?
KIRK: Hmm?
ADAMS: Ah. I was afraid you would ask about this, Captain. One doesn't like to talk about their personal failures, you know? It was just an experiment that went wrong, I'm afraid.
KIRK: May I see it?
NOEL: Captain, if something hasn't worked out and therefore has no scientific fact
KIRK: Shall we leave it up to the doctor?
NOEL: Since you brought me down here for advice, Captain
KIRK: One of the advantages of being a Captain, Doctor, is being able to ask for advice without necessarily having to take it.
ADAMS: I think I'll have to award that round to the Captain, Helen. You're fighting over your weight. All right, let's take a look.

[Sickbay]

GELDER: I'm not a criminal! I do not require neural neutraliser.
SPOCK: Neural neutraliser. Can you explain that, Doctor Van Gelder?
GELDER: A room. A device. Door. Control panel. I see it. A device. A light! The light!
SPOCK: This room. What happens there?
GELDER: (screams)

[Treatment room]

ADAMS: A neural neutraliser. Experimental. Actually, we don't expect to get much use out of it at all. That beam from above neutralises brain waves, relaxes the patient's mind. Does them no harm, of course, and the effects are only temporary.
KIRK: One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good
ADAMS: Why do we go on using it, hmm, Captain? Hope. Yes, yes, there's always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more violent cases.
NOEL: Tranquillisers are fine, Captain, but to continually pump chemicals into a person's bloodstream
ADAMS: Exactly my point, Helen. Yes. Shall we? (he and Noel leave)
KIRK: (to therapist) How does it work?
THERAPIST: Quite simple. Off on switches, and the large control here changes the strength of the brain neutralising beam.
ADAMS: Captain, you remind me of the ancient sceptic who demanded of the wise old sage to be taught all the world's wisdom while standing on one foot.
NOEL: Beam neutralising has been experimented with on Earth, Captain. I'm not acquainted with this particular style of equipment, but I can assure you that Doctor Adams has not created a chamber of horrors here.
KIRK: I didn't mean to suggest that he had. The reason I asked, sir, was you haven't mentioned where Doctor Van Gelder's injury occurred.
ADAMS: Right here, Captain. Yes, Simon was a very stubborn man. He could've sat in that room for years with the beam at that volume or even higher. Or if he simply had someone standing by to snap it off in case he got into trouble, but, but no. He tried it alone and on full volume. It's a pity.
KIRK: (to therapist) Thank you. (leaves)
THERAPIST: (to man in treatment chair) You will forget all you have heard. To remember any portion of it, any word, will cause you pain, terrible pain, growing more terrible as you fight to remember.

[Sickbay]

SPOCK: Can you give us your present location, Captain?
KIRK [OC]: In Doctor Adams' study, Mister Spock. Why?
SPOCK: Then you're with Doctor Adams now.
KIRK [OC]: Affirmative.
SPOCK: Captain, Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment room. The term was neural neutraliser.

[Adam's study]

KIRK: Yes. He was injured there. I've seen the room. Doctor Adams explained

[Sickbay]

KIRK [OC]: the mistake Van Gelder made.

[Adam's study]

KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Spock. Anything further?
ADAMS: Your Mister Spock sounds like a very excellent second in command, Captain Kirk. Please tell him to go ahead and speak freely. I have to check in with a member of my staff anyway.
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor Adams.
ADAMS: Excuse me.
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. Doctor Adams has left with some things to attend to. What is it, Mister Spock?

[Sickbay]

SPOCK: Van Gelder is extremely agitated, Captain, and warns that you are in danger.

[Adam's study]

NOEL: Oh, that's foolish.
SPOCK [OC]: Please repeat, Captain. I didn't receive that.
KIRK: Tell McCoy the technical expert he sent along with me insists that any concern is unjustified. According to Adams, Van Gelder created his own problem.
NOEL: He's suffering from

[Sickbay]

NOEL [OC]: neuro-synapse damage, as if his brain were short-circuited. It's no wonder he's having delusions.
MCCOY: McCoy here. Received and understood.

[Adam's study]

MCCOY [OC]: But we still have some doubts up here, Captain. Can you tell us any more?
KIRK: Not really.
SPOCK: When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?
KIRK: I think we'll spend the night here, Mister Spock.

[Sickbay]

GELDER: No! No, no, no.
SPOCK: And you will continue to check in every four hours?
KIRK [OC]: Affirmative.

[Adam's study]

KIRK: Kirk out.

[Sickbay]

GELDER: No! No. No, don't let them! You must warn your captain. No! No! Don't let him stay! Don't let him stay! Don't! No. No. Don't hypo me. Please, don't hypo me. I'll try not to fight. I'll try. But you must listen. Warn your Captain. Doctor Adams. Doc, Doctor Adams will destroy.
SPOCK: Destroy how? What?
GELDER: Right death.

SPOCK [OC]: Enterprise log. First officer Spock, acting captain. I must now use an ancient Vulcan technique to probe into Van Gelder's tortured mind.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Spock, if there's the slightest possibility it might help.
SPOCK: I've never used it on a human, Doctor.
MCCOY: If there's any way we can look into this man's mind to see if what he's seeing is real or delusion
SPOCK: It's a hidden, personal thing to the Vulcan people, part of our private lives.
MCCOY: Now look, Spock, Jim Kirk could be in real trouble. Will it work or not?
SPOCK: It could be dangerous. Do you understand? It requires I make pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels.
GELDER: You must open my mind. Let me warn you and explain to you.
SPOCK: This will not affect you, Doctor McCoy, only the person I touch. It is not hypnosis.
MCCOY: I understand. (Spock puts his hands on Gelder's face) Good, the reading's levelling.
SPOCK: You begin to feel a strange euphoria. Your body floats.
GELDER: Yes, I begin to feel it.
SPOCK: Open your mind. We move together. Our minds sharing the same thoughts.

[Noel's room]

KIRK: Good evening.
NOEL: Good evening.
KIRK: What did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon?
NOEL: You could've waited until tomorrow morning to ask me that, Captain.
KIRK: I didn't.
NOEL: I thought they were happy, well-adjusted.
KIRK: But a bit blank.
NOEL: Captain, if you're questioning the methods of a man like Tristan Adams
KIRK: I'd like to see that treatment room again. You say you're somewhat familiar with the theory behind it?
NOEL: Yes, somewhat, but if you'd simply state any doubts you have to Doctor Adams
KIRK: And if he's lying, he'll continue to lie, and I won't find out a thing. The only way I can be sure is to see that machine at work, or is that too impractical and unscientific of me, Doctor? Well?
NOEL: Coming.

[Sickbay]

SPOCK: What is our name? Who are we?
GELDER: We are Simon Van Gelder.
SPOCK: Doctor Adams. The neural neutraliser. What did he do to us?
GELDER: He can reshape any mind he chooses. He used it to erase our memories, put his own thoughts there. He was surprised it took so much power. We fought him, remember? But we grew so tired, our minds so blank, so open, that any thought he placed there became our thoughts. Our minds so empty like a sponge, needing thoughts, begging. Empty. Loneliness. So lonely to be sitting there empty, wanting any word from him. Love.
SPOCK: Yes.
GELDER: Hate.
SPOCK: Yes.
GELDER: Live.
SPOCK: Yes.
GELDER: Die.
SPOCK: Yes.
GELDER: Such agony to be empty.
SPOCK: Empty.
GELDER: Lonely.
SPOCK: Lonely.
GELDER: So empty.
SPOCK: Empty.
GELDER: So empty.

[Treatment room]

KIRK: I have no desire to damage my brain. Can this be handled with reasonable safety? Yes or no?
NOEL: Yes.
KIRK: And will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in the slightest?
NOEL: Yes, Captain. I know my profession. (Kirk sits in treatment chair) Ready?
KIRK: Mm-hmm.
NOEL: We'll try minimum intensity, a second or two. (light turns)
KIRK: Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two.
NOEL: We already tried it for that long, Captain.
KIRK: Nothing happened.
NOEL: Something happened. Your face went completely blank.
KIRK: Try a harmless suggestion.
NOEL: (light turns) You're hungry.
KIRK: You know, when we finally get through this I'd like to locate and raid a kitchen somewhere.
NOEL: I put that suggestion in your mind, Captain. I said simply that you were hungry.
KIRK: Remarkably effective for a device that Doctor Adams was going to abandon.
NOEL: I think we should try this again.
KIRK: Yes. Pick something unusual, an unusual suggestion, something we can both be sure of.
NOEL: (light turns) At the Christmas party, we met, we danced, you talked about the stars. I suggest now that it happened in a different way. You swept me off my feet and carried me to your cabin.

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK: Merry Christmas.
NOEL: Captain, if your crew saw you carry me here.
KIRK: My crew is sworn to secrecy.
NOEL: But my reputation. I mean, just having met like this. Of course, it would be different if you cared for me.
KIRK: You want me to manufacture a lie, wrap it up as a Christmas present for you?
NOEL: No, I prefer honesty. (they kiss)

[Treatment room]

ADAMS: Now Captain Kirk is going to have a complete demonstration. I want there to be no doubts whatsoever in his mind. Mmm. You're madly in love with Helen, Captain. You'd lie, cheat, steal for her, sacrifice your career, your reputation.
NOEL: No, Doctor! No!
ADAMS: The pain. Do you feel it, Captain? You must have her, or the pain grows worse, the pain, the longing for her.
KIRK: Helen.
NOEL: No.
ADAMS: For years, you've loved her, Captain, for years.
KIRK: For years, I've loved you.
ADAMS: You must continue to remember that, Captain. And now, she's gone. (machine to maximum)
KIRK: Helen! Helen, don't go! I need you, Helen!
ADAMS: (reduces intensity) Now Captain, you must take your phaser weapon and drop it on the floor. Captain, the pain increases unless you obey me.
KIRK: I must drop it.
ADAMS: Very good, Captain. Very good indeed. And now your communicator. Drop it on the floor.
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Argh! (machine to maximum) Kirk to Enterprise. Argh!
NOEL: No!

[Kirk's room]

NOEL: They've taken you from the room, Captain. You're in your own quarters now.
KIRK: Helen. Helen, for years I've loved you. Helen.
NOEL: Try to remember.
KIRK: I've loved you.
NOEL: He placed all that in your mind.
KIRK: For years.
NOEL: Remember. Doctor Adams took the controls away from me. Do you remember the pain and then his voice? Remember?
KIRK: Yes. Yes, I remember. I remember. Helen. Look. The duct. The duct. Give me a hand here. Pull. (cover comes open) Air conditioning. It has to connect with other ducts and tunnels. You can get through this. It might lead to the power supply. Short-circuited, it would cut off the security force field. Have you had any training in hyper-power circuits?
NOEL: No.
KIRK: Megavoltage. Touch the wrong line, and you're dead.
NOEL: Anything's better than Adams' treatment room. (he closes the cover behind her and the door opens) Time for another treatment?

[Treatment room]

ADAMS: Please don't fight me, Captain. The pain only gets worse when you doubt me. You believe in me completely.
KIRK: I believe in you.
ADAMS: You trust me completely.
KIRK: I trust you.
ADAMS: Excellent, Captain. I compliment you. Do you know Doctor Van Gelder was down on his hands and knees sobbing at this point? It was so gratifying. I'm so fortunate to have had a couple of excellent specimens to, to work with. I've learned a great deal.
LETHE: The woman doctor. She's gone, Doctor Adams.
ADAMS: Notify security at once, Lethe. Where is she, Captain?
KIRK: I, argh, I don't know.
ADAMS: Where is Helen And with what instructions?
KIRK: I don't know. (collapses)
(Noel makes it to the power control room and finds an off switch but it won't move)

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: Emergency channel D.
BERKELEY: It's no good, Mister Spock. I can't break through their force field.
SPOCK: Keep trying.
(Noel hides as guards search for her, and when they go she pulls down the master high voltage switch. A guard grabs her)

[Treatment room]

ADAMS: Put him back in the chair, Eli, and find that girl. (Kirk knocks them both out and leaves)
(the guard turns the power back on again, but when he reaches for Noel she pushes him against the high volt grid and he fries, cutting the power again)

[Transporter room]

BERKELEY: Mister Spock, the force field is gone. I can send you right to the source of the interruption.
SPOCK: (to McCoy) Get some security people and follow me down. Energise.

[Power control room]

(Noel dashes back into the aircon tunnels)
SPOCK: (pushes a load of buttons) Enterprise, this is Spock. Force field has been eliminated. (turns main power back on again)

[Kirk's room]

NOEL: Captain. Captain?
KIRK: (helps her out of vent) Helen, are you all right? (kisses her)
NOEL: Yes. This isn't right, Captain. (Spock enters) Doctor Adams did this to you.
KIRK: Doctor Adams? Doctor A. The treatment room. Follow me.

[Treatment room]

MCCOY: Jim! (Kirk turns machine off)
KIRK: The power came on.
MCCOY: He's dead, Captain.
NOEL: The machine wasn't on high enough to kill.
KIRK: But he was alone. Can you imagine the mind emptied by that thing? Without even a tormentor for company.
NOEL: I understand.

[Bridge]

UHURA: Oh, Captain, there was a message from Tantalus colony, sir.
SPOCK: It was from Van Gelder. He thought you'd like to know the treatment room had been dismantled and the equipment destroyed.
KIRK: Thank you.
MCCOY: It's hard to believe that a man could die of loneliness.
KIRK: Not when you've sat in that room. Take us out of orbit, Mister Spock. Ahead warp factor one.
SPOCK: Acknowledged, Captain. Warp factor one.
