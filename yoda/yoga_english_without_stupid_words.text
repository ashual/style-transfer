This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to hold on a little longer. There's no other way. Survival procedures, Mister Sulu.

Yes, he is.
Yes, he is.  
How can he die? Can I survive without him?
He die, how can?  Can I survive without him?  
I don't know, Jim.
I not know, jim.  
Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be afraid. I won't let go. Hold on. You won't be afraid if you use your mind and think! Think! You can do it. That's it!
Be afraid, do not.  My hand, here is.  Hold on.  To be afraid you have not.  Let go I will not.  Hold on.  Be afraid if you use your mind and think you will not!  Think!  Do it, you can.  It that is!

Jim, no different than anyone else, you are.  Our darker side, we all have.  It, we need it!  Half of what we are, it is.  Really ugly it is not, human, it is human.
Human.
Human.  
Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right. Without the negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain. You couldn't be, and you know it. Your strength of command lies mostly in him.
Yes, human.  Much what, makes you the man you are, is he.  To agree with spock, god forbid I should have, but right, he was right. Without the negative side, be the captain you would not.  Be you could not, and you know it.  Of command lies mostly in him your strength.

The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. For you see, he was afraid and you weren't.

We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest we send the animal through. Captain.

Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know. Animal could have died of some kind of shock.
Autopsy in-depth.  Hurry.  I not know.  Died of some kind of shock, could animal have.  
For once, I agree with you.
For once, with you I agree.  
I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a full post-mortem.
Have, I said could, mister spock.  Know until we get a full post-mortem we will not.  
No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror.
Necessary to know that the animal was terrified, no autopsy is, confused.  Split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again, was it.  Thus shock induced by blind terror.
Yes, yes, that sounds likely.

Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones. Their lives
Yes, right, that is.  The men.  To take the chance, have we, bones.  Their lives.  
Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction. Then you'd die. They'd die, anyway. Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory!
Shock suppose it was not, jim.  Caused by transporter malfunction, suppose death was. Then die, you would.  Die, they would die, anyway.  Jim, you, risk your life on a theory,  cannot!
Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well.

No. No, I'm not.
No.  No, not, I am not.
