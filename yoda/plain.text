It looks right.
The nitrogen cycle, it has to be.
That is a very good question.
Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice?
What's the matter with you? How should I know?
Where is she? Has something happened to her?
Don't you feel all right?
Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you.
I've got to find Janice.
That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators.
We're trying, Mister Spock. We're trying very hard.
We've got to have those communicators, Jim.
This is the vaccine?
That's what the computers will tell us.
Without them, it could be a beaker full of death.
I don't care.
Sometimes it happens.
That's not true. It just happens sometimes.
It could be these meteorites.
No, it's something else. There's still something out there.
Steady as we go.
We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.
Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years.
We aren't going to go, to be certain?
Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.
What makes you think I need one?
Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.
All decks have acknowledged, sir.
She's replacing your former yeoman, sir.
We've settled into orbit, sir.
Zero point nine of Earth.
MAN: They're men. They're humans.
The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon.
That's affirmative on the
I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
Their health is excellent. Almost too good.
I don't understand.
You will. You're a perfect choice.
You're not speaking, yet I can hear you.
Any estimate what they might want one of us for?
This is Rigel Seven.
Please, we must hide ourselves.
Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.
But it's only a dream.
You have to kill him as you did here before.
Why would an illusion be frightened?
Because that's the way you imagined me.
Why are you here?
Are you real?
As real as you wish.
Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.
You're a fool.
Increase to full power! Can you give us any more?
Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I could answer.
How far can they control my mind?
But they try to trick me with their illusions.
War, thousands of centuries ago.
That's why it's so barren up there?
Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.
You said that if I answered questions
Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?
And if I prefer
That's very interesting.
You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?
Hey, your coffee. Is it good to be home?
This is a lovely place to rest.
Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?
Nice place you have here, Mister Pike.
Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?
No! Let me finish!
But we were a party of six.
We were the only ones transported.
It's not fair. You don't need them.
He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.
Picked her? For what? I don't understand.
Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.
Offspring as in he's Adam. Is that it?
It's not fair. I did what you asked.
Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead.
Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out.
There's nothing. Every system aboard is fading out.
Now you hold still, or I'll break your neck.
Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil.
I've had some samples of how good they are.
I want to contact our ship.
What is that?
Captain, we have transporter control now.
Let's get back to the ship.
I can't. I can't go with you.
You see why I can't go with you.
You'll give her back her illusion of beauty?
Mister Spock, the system is coming on again.
What's happened to Vina?
Isn't she coming with us?
No. No, and I agreed with her reasons.
Oh, I feel fine, just fine.
Yeoman! You've delivered your report.
Eve as in Adam?
It's good to see you.
Let me look at you.
A little less mouth, Darnell.
Why don't you step outside, Darnell.
Maybe I'll step outside, too.
What? And let Plum examine me all alone?
A nickname I gave Leonard when we were very young.
Professor Crater, I'm Captain Kirk. This is
He's all yours, Plum. Doctor McCoy.
Did I hear you call him Doctor McCoy?
McCoy. I've heard Nancy speak of a Doctor McCoy.
That's me. Didn't she mention I was here?
You've seen Nancy?
She went out to get you.
You've seen her too? You were with the good Doctor?
Open your mouth.
Why, I thought the machine
Dead, Jim. Strange. A red mottling all over his face.
Well, I, I
Take it easy, Nancy. Just tell us what you know.
Salt. You did ask them about more salt tablets?
I'll take care of the provisioning, Nancy.
I was just trying to start a conversation.
Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura.
I'm not surprised, Mister Spock.
I don't believe it.
Something new to me.
Hmm. Well then, this man wasn't poisoned.
There were bits of the plant in his mouth.
Then what kills a healthy man
What is it?
I'd rather not put it on the speaker.
So improbable we almost didn't check it.
Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it.
This man has no salt in his body at all.
Can you explain that, Doctor?
He would die almost instantly.
How? There isn't a mark on his body.
Except the red rings on his face.
I thought it was, sir. Another error on my part.
Mrs. Crater. I won't ask again.
Possibly at the other diggings. We don't keep military logs
But you can't do that.
Jim, he's run off.
Jim! Jim, it's Sturgeon. He's dead.
Nancy, it's Leonard!
We're beaming aboard the ship, Doctor.
You can't leave her!
We can't search this whole planet on foot.
Kirk to Bridge.
There's a body down there. Sturgeon.
You could use some sleep, Bones.
Why don't you go chase an asteroid?
Hey, Janice, is that for me?
Don't you wish it was?
Where are you, Sulu?
I've got your tray.
May the Great Bird of the Galaxy bless your planet.
Thank you. Hello, Beauregard. How are you today, darling?
No, it's a he plant. A girl can tell.
Una kafeeri Hur. You're Swahili?
I'd better get this tray back. Bye, Beauregard.
Wait a minute, I'll walk along.
Lieutenant Uhura. On my way, sir.
McCoy to Bridge. Captain there?
I think you should. I'll get you some water.
Look at his face!
You're so tired, darling. Just rest now.
Go away! We don't want you here.
We? Where's your wife, Professor? We're concerned about her.
I'm armed. Go away.
Where's your wife, Professor?
She's no concern of yours.
Stand by, Mister Sulu. Spock has something.
He beamed up to the ship with us.
Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive.
Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult.
Why risk your life for his?
He's not in supply and maintenance.
He, whatever, was probably your crewman, too, Lieutenant.
The creature leading you a merry chase, Mister Sulu?
She was the last of her kind.
The last of her kind?
Just stunned. You'll be able to think in a minute.
And now they're gone. Is that what you mean?
Where's your wife? Where is she now?
Dead. Buried up on the hill. It killed her.
Oh, a year, or was it two?
Kirk to Enterprise.
Go to GQ four.
Kirk to transporter room. Three to beam up.
There's one, Professor. Your creature is killing my people.
Yeoman Rand, how long was this Green with you?
Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is reckless.
A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room.
And it becomes Nancy for you.
You don't understand.
Are you going to help us find it?
Sorry, I can't.
I'll accompany you, Doctor.
Dead. But it had you, too.
Easy, easy. Nobodies going to
But you must help me!
She's not Nancy, Bones.
Are you insane?
You're frightening her, Jim.
McCoy, get out of the way!
Are you out of your mind?
Get out of the way.
It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly!
It's killing the captain! Shoot, quick!
I won't shoot Nancy.
I'm sorry, Bones.
Ready to leave orbit, Captain.
All right, Chief, begin materialisation. Captain Ramart, I'm Captain Kirk.
This is my navigator Tom Nellis.
How do you do?
How do you do?
How many humans like me on this ship?
That's perfect. It's the exact word.
You keep interrupting, Mister Evans. That's considered wrong.
We have a large supply of entertainment tapes, gentlemen.
We're fine, thank you. Pleasant journey, Captain.
Yes, sir. Come with me, please.
Are you a girl? Is that a girl?
That's a girl.
Why does he call me Mister Evans?
Because that's your name.
He's not, well, he isn't like Captain Ramart.
Well, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie.
Do you like me?
I brought you a present.
Do you like that kind?
It's a present.
Can't you stay and talk a little while?
I thought. Don't be angry. I didn't, I wanted.
Don't be angry.
Good. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock is working out
The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere.
Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life.
And probes have been known to be wrong, Spock.
Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally?
I'm sorry. I did it again, didn't I.
Well, how did you do that?
I don't believe this!
Say it right out, Charlie. That usually works.
I don't know.
I'm on my way to the Bridge now.
Can I come with you?
I don't think so, Charlie.
I won't get in the way.
They're not transmitting.
It wasn't very well constructed.
You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie?
I don't know.
Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain.
The debris is what's left of the Antares.
Chief, have you been
My own concern is more immediate. The boy.
I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time?
I prefer to call it inspired.
As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours.
I place you in the hands of our chess master.
I know what it is. Let's play.
No, it wasn't.
No, it isn't.
If you'll excuse me.
I thought you might enjoy meeting someone your own age.
Can I talk to you, alone.
Excuse me. I must be wanted somewhere.
Exactly, and he's
I talked to him about the swat.
Yes, Yeoman, I'll talk to him. I'll look into it.
Oh, I won't hit her like that anymore.
No, there's more to it than that.
What if you care for someone? What do you do?
You don't think Janice. You. She could love me!
Then what am I going to do?
I'm trying, but I don't know how.
I don't want to do that.
Well, it makes it hard to teach you
I don't want to do that.
All right, Charlie. Lesson's over for today.
You were going to teach me how to fight.
Come on, Charlie. Try it. Attaboy. Let's go.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
Don't laugh at me.
Don't laugh at me!
What happened to him, Charlie?
That's no answer.
What are you going to do to me?
Go to your quarters.
He was going to hurt me.
I won't let you.
That's your choice, Charlie.
I won't let them hurt me.
They won't hurt you.
He doesn't understand what life is. He's a boy.
You wanted to ask me something, he said.
Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie?
I don't know.
We're in the hands of an adolescent.
You don't need all that subspace chatter.
See to her, Doctor.
That's enough, Charlie.
Don't you think he's funny? I think he's funny.
You don't walk into a room without knocking.
I love you.
You don't know what the word means.
My legs. They're broken.
And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed?
I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on.
Out of the question.
Not so far as we know.
I've got your ship, Captain.
I could've sent you away before, but I didn't.
You're going to have to take me on.
Don't make me do it now.
It's all right, Yeoman.
The boy belongs with his own kind.
That would be impossible.
Is there nothing you can do?
It's all right, Yeoman. It's all over now.
Right, sir. All life systems were off, sir.
Someone strangled this woman.
Engineer at his post?
All station personnel are dead.
Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before.
How are they?
They're fine, Jim.
You'd better get some rest.
Or at least none your tricorders could register.
It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.
Foil. It's a rapier. A thin sword.
All right. So what do you do with it?
What do you mean, what do you do with it?
What's with him?
You're all steamed up, Joe.
What are you doing, Joe?
Joey, don't be a fool.
Let me go.
Was he trying to kill himself?
Doesn't sound like the man I know.
His breathing rate is dropping, Doctor.
Compensate with the respirator. Stand by to close. Closing.
What is it?
Why is this man dying? Hypo.
He's dead, Doctor.
The wounds were not that severe.
Rate of compaction seems constant.
Why not? Light workout will take the edge off.
Sulu, what about. Hey, Sulu, don't be a fool!
That's a supposition, Doctor, not a fact.
That's exactly what I was going to ask.
That's not good enough.
Well, we're doing everything that's possible.
Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?
You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?
You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this station.
Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley.
Sickbay? Exactly where I was heading, sir.
He died, didn't he.
What were their symptoms?
Helm is not answering to control.
Warp us out of here.
Impulse power then. Blast us out of this orbit.
Engine room, we need power!
Mister Scott, acknowledge. Our controls are dead. Take her.
Sulu, give me that.
I'll protect you, fair maiden.
I'd like you to teach me that sometime.
Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
Scotty, we need power. Engine room, acknowledge!
This is Captain Kevin Thomas Riley of the starship Enterprise.
Clear that tube, will you?
He ran in, said you wanted us on the Bridge.
He's cut off both helm and power.
Can't you get to the auxiliary?
Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.
I can't, sir. He's cut off the alert channels.
I can't, sir. There's no way to do it.
Sickbay to Bridge.
Can you tie me in to the Sickbay?
And tears bedim your loving eyes. Oh,
Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've stabilised, but still spiraling down.
Get me Sickbay.
Oh, yes, sir. I'll take you home again, Janice
We have fourteen minutes left.
Get him out of here.
Yes, sir. I'll keep trying.
Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?
He's gone to the lab.
What is it, Nurse?
Nurse, you should
I'm in control of my emotions.
I am sorry.
I'll take. No dance tonight.
Get him out of here.
Scotty, we haven't got much time left.
What is it?
Scotty, we've got six.
We can balance our engines into a controlled implosion.
That's only a theory. It's never been done.
Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?
Mister Spock is not on the Bridge, Captain.
McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum.
Where have you been? What happened?
My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.
We've got four minutes, maybe five.
We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance.
It's never been done.
Jim, there is an intermix formula.
Now I know why it's called she.
Engine room. We're set. Hyperbolic course.
Direction. Direction. It doesn't matter. The way we came.
That'll take four minutes.
Are you all right, Jim?
We found a cure. We're over that part of it.
Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded.
Captain, my velocity gauge is off the scale.
We're back to normal time, Captain.
The time warp. What did it do to us?
Steady as she goes.
That should make a good specimen.
I fell off that bank, sir. Cut my hand.
Yes, sir. Geological Technician Fisher. Ready to beam up.
I don't know. Some kind of yellow ore.
That acted like a burnout.
Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy.
Let me give you a hand.
Wilson will be right back, sir.
All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to.
Ship's manifests, sir. I think they're in order now.
What can I do for you, Jim?
Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?
Is there something I can do for you, Captain?
Our good doctor's been putting you on again.
I'll tell him you were properly annoyed.
What is it, Scotty?
Jim will do here, Janice.
I was sure I scratched you. I was frightened. Maybe
Yeoman. I was in my room. It wasn't me.
It wasn't me!
It was you, sir.
Do you know what you're saying?
Yes, I know what I'm saying.
Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go.
How did all this happen?
How long will it take you to find the trouble?
Can't say, sir.
We're doing everything we can, sir.
About your double, Captain.
Section chiefs, assign personnel to the search. All search parties
I'm Captain Kirk!
Wilson, give me your phaser.
How have you been?
It's already twenty degrees below zero. Can't exactly
Isn't there any way we can help them?
Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They won't operate.
Then we've got to get those men up.
We've got to find him before he, but how?
No. I don't want anyone else to see the
Captain, you ordered me to tell you.
Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me?
You have a point, Spock?
What is your point, Mister Spock?
You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that!
I'll see what we can do.
How bad is it?
I gave everybody the afternoon off. I'm watching the store.
He's not dying?
How can he die? Can I survive without him?
I don't know, Jim.
What do I have?
You have the goodness.
Not enough. I have a ship to command.
What is it?
We've found a way to get the transporter working, sir.
Don't hurt him.
If this doesn't work, I don't know what will.
He's dead, Jim.
For once, I agree with you.
Aren't you forgetting something, Captain?
No, I don't think I've for
Are you relinquishing your command, Captain?
No. No, I'm not.
Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu. Can't wait. Can't let them die.
Go through the transporter, both of us.
Yeoman, I owe you an explanation.
But what about
Captain, I thought the plan
Mister Spock, which one? What do we do?
We'll let the captain handle this.
Then we'll both die.
You will. Both of us.
You'll have to hold on to him, Captain.
If this doesn't work.
Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us.
Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir?
The impostor's back where he belongs. Let's forget him.
Don't lose him, Mister Sulu.
If it is, he'll soon overload his engines.
Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard.
Changing course again. He knows we're after him all right.
Stay with him, Mister Sulu. Communication?
He's receiving us alright.
He's seen the asteroids too, sir.
Stay with him. He'll try to lose us in them.
Try to warn him. If he loses power now
There go his engines, sir.
He's drifting into the asteroid belt, Captain.
We're overloading, Captain. Engine temperatures climbing.
That was one of our lithium crystal circuits, sir.
I'm getting a distress signal call from them, sir.
Scotty, we're getting a distress signal.
We're locked onto something, Captain.
You're aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
How many more in your crew?
Another lithium circuit. Now supplementing with battery power, sir.
Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard?
I don't know, sir. With those three lithium crystals gone
It'll take longer on battery power.
There she goes.
It's all right, darlings. We're in good hands.
Bridge to transporter room.
We're clearing the asteroid belt now, Captain.
That fellow sounded a mite upset, didn't he?
Amen to that, Scotty.
I'll handle the conversation, darling.
The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain.
Good. Now, if you don't mind telling
And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain?
Well, no, Captain. This is me cargo.
Walsh. Leo Walsh. You destroyed me ship, Captain.
We've got trouble, Mister Spock.
I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott.
Can't. We blew the whole converter assembly.
Harry! Where were you?
Shh! Calm down now, darlings. Would you mind waiting outside?
What if they ask about
They won't. Have you no place to go lads?
They'll notice we're different.
The entire ship's power is feeding through one lithium crystal.
Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel.
State your name for the record.
State your correct name for the record.
Of course not. Gentlemen, I'm simply an honest businessman.
If it can read our minds, too.
It can't, darling. It can't. Just what's on the record.
Untrue! I have a master's ticket.
Destination and purpose of journey?
Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what?
I recruit wives for settlers, a difficult but satisfying task.
Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings?
Er, that's sufficient. Strike that from the record.
Did these ladies come voluntarily?
That's enough, Evie.
Only heaven's own truth, which I've just given you.
Miss McHuron, if you don't mind
Our last crystal, sir. It's gone.
May I come in?
I was wondering what this place looked like. It's fascinating.
Would, Would you walk past my panel again, please?
Oh, why? You're not giving me an examination, are you?
Yes, if they need it.
No. I'm just me.
I wonder what makes it do that.
Captain? I hope you don't mind.
As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do.
They're probably just lonely. I can understand loneliness.
Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron
Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is.
Neither have I.
Miss McHuron, I don't
Just three? You're sure?
Yes. The miners are healthy and fairly young.
And they've been there?
I asked for a preorbital course, Mister Farrell.
I'll get you there.
What are they?
You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing?
I asked you first.
I don't follow you.
I don't either.
We'll make orbit, sir. A temporary one.
We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours.
What if someone sees us like this?
I'm going back to what I was. Ugly.
I can't stand myself like this.
Why did you hide them, Harry? Don't you trust us?
Fine. I'm authorised to pay an equitable price.
What did you have in mind?
And you must be Herm Gossett.
It's still no deal.
When I have the time, Kirk.
We're busy, Mister Kirk.
We don't have the time to spare, Captain.
You got a better idea?
Dance with me.
Would you like to dance?
I'm cutting in.
What's the matter with you?
You can't go out there. You'll get killed.
Just have those crystals here when I get back.
Losing communications with the miners, sir. Magnetic storm seems worse.
No, sir. He and the girl are still missing.
Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left?
That's Ben Childress' quarters.
Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room.
The name of this game.
I had things where I wanted them.
You find me a well, some decent water, then talk.
The red eight ought to go on the black nine.
I got tired of you. I slumped.
Thank heaven you found her.
She's been bubbling with gratitude ever since.
Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug.
He gave it to the women before you met them.
Mister Childress, I
Is that what it means?
Yes, that's what it means!
What happened to my partners?
If they want to.
You can't condemn the women.
A fake, pumped up by a drug.
I swallowed it.
Yes, they took away my drug and substituted that.
But that can't be.
There's only one kind of woman.
Stand by. Do I beam down a search party?
No, the crystals are here, and you're welcome to them.
You've got someone up there called the Enterprise.
Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd.
They'll throw away the key.
Why should I work your side of the street?
Out of orbit, sir.
Ready to beam down. Energise. Energise.
I just don't understand the problem, sir.
You're beaming cargo down to a penal colony, Mister Berkeley.
U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
A cage is a cage, Jim.
Message, Captain. Switching to speaker.
Security control, this is the Bridge. Come in.
Repeat, approach with extreme caution. Bridge out.
Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
Make that definite, Doctor. He's aboard.
We'll keep you posted, Doctor. Kirk out.
Where's the captain? Which one of you is the captain?
I'm Captain Kirk.
My name is Van Gelder. I want asylum.
No promises. Give me the weapon.
Your report said he was quite talkative.
Not our problem, Bones.
What did you say your name was?
Committed to Tantalus colony when?
Assigned there six months ago as Doctor Adams' associate.
Ship to surface, Tantalus colony.
U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
Doctor Adams, regarding your escaped man
No casualties, sir. This man is Doctor Simon Van Gelder?
Jim, that doesn't quite ring true.
Er, Doctor Adams, please stand by. Explain.
They're clean, decent hospitals for sick minds.
Locked in, sir. Ready to beam down.
You dropped in
This is another time, another place, and another situation.
Hello Captain Kirk, and er
Thank you. Thank you, Captain. Welcome to Devil's Island, Doctor.
I shall indeed. Won't you?
I believe regulations call for me to check my weapon.
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
I love my work.
Before you came here
I was another person, malignant, hateful.
May I ask what crime you committed?
Does it matter? That person no longer exists.
A shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy.
Shall we leave it up to the doctor?
Since you brought me down here for advice, Captain
I'm not a criminal! I do not require neural neutraliser.
Neural neutraliser. Can you explain that, Doctor Van Gelder?
One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good
Can you give us your present location, Captain?
Then you're with Doctor Adams now.
Oh, that's foolish.
He's suffering from
When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?
I think we'll spend the night here, Mister Spock.
And you will continue to check in every four hours?
Spock, if there's the slightest possibility it might help.
I've never used it on a human, Doctor.
You begin to feel a strange euphoria. Your body floats.
Yes, I begin to feel it.
But a bit blank.
What is our name? Who are we?
We are Simon Van Gelder.
Such agony to be empty.
Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two.
We already tried it for that long, Captain.
I think we should try this again.
Captain, if your crew saw you carry me here.
My crew is sworn to secrecy.
For years, you've loved her, Captain, for years.
For years, I've loved you.
Helen! Helen, don't go! I need you, Helen!
How did she die? What day?
Spock, I believe I'm in love with Edith Keeler.
Jim, Edith Keeler must die.
I am unconscious, or demented.
Are you following me, sir?
Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop.
No, of course you didn't.
It's not yet time. McCoy isn't here.
I thought you might like to see the evening paper.
But if you're not, what are you?
I try to.
Lots of people drink from the wrong bottle sometimes.
A who movie?
A Clark Gable. Don't you know?
Yes. He's in the Mission. He's
What is it?
McCoy! He's in
We were successful.
Let's get the hell out of here.
What was that?
I want facts, not poetry.
That's impossible. What you're describing
All stations to immediate alert status. Stand by.
Well, what is it, this object? Its physical makeup?
Speculation. Could this being present any danger to the ship?
I'll talk to him later. Thank you. Kirk out.
I see. You mean, we're the bait.
You say this one man
Thing destroyed your entire civilisation.
How did you escape?
Is he the thing that attacked you?
Yes. I give you my word. I swear it.
We don't have any other facts, any information.
Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest?
Let's have it. The truth this time.
Can you identify that?
I'm trying, Captain.
I saw it again. The thing. It attacked me.
Let's get out of here.
Let's get back to the ship.
If there's a shred of truth to what Lazarus said
Hard to believe.
Doctor McCoy asking to see you in sickbay, Captain.
Where is he?
Lazarus, are you all right?
Yes. But impatient. Have you decided to help me yet?
This is no joke, Jim. I know what I saw.
Source of radiation, Captain.
How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before?
Because it is not there.
But it is there.
You refer to the humanoid?
Yes. We've got him, Captain, we've got him.
I warn you, Captain. You'll give me the crystals.
Don't threaten me, Lazarus.
No threat intended. Captain, I'll have my vengeance.
I'll check, sir.
How'd this beast get aboard my ship?
He did. Isn't that enough?
No. He didn't transport up. A report would've been made.
Why does he need the crystals? For what reason?
What do you believe now, Captain?
Unable to locate the source of radiation.
Why not? You had it spotted on the Enterprise.
It has simply disappeared, Captain.
He's coming out of it now.
It's all right. You're on board the Enterprise.
The rock, I
How's your head?
Why shouldn't I?
I have some questions I want to ask you.
Go ahead. It's all right.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
I'll have the truth now.
What are you saying?
He's in a lot of pain.
Well, don't worry, he's not going anywhere. Not this time.
Correct. Which would seem to be impossible.
Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside.
Which is physically impossible for one man.
Quite right. Unquestionably, there are two of him.
I don't follow you.
No, I've got to stay
All available personnel, on the double. Spock, with me.
Under control, sir, but it couldn't have started by itself.
Lazarus. A trick to get the crystals.
Sir, you shouldn't be in here.
Oh, I didn't know.
Spock to Bridge.
Done. No! Don't! Not you!
Welcome, Captain. I wasn't expecting you.
Not completely. This is a parallel universe?
And if identical particles meet
He has two more.
Exactly what did I pass through?
And the universe is safe.
So you're the terrible thing, the murdering monster. The creature.
I understand. What do you want me to do?
You can't hold him forever.
Can't I, Captain? You destroy his ship.
If I destroy his ship, won't yours also be destroyed?
And your door will be closed.
Yes, and so will his.
Send him to me. I'll be waiting.
No! No! No, I'm not ready! I'm not ready!
Take these crystals to the Enterprise.
I must destroy that ship completely.
What of Lazarus?
And what of Lazarus?
Stand by to fire.
There is, of course, no escape for them, sir.
Captain, the universe is safe.
We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt.
Damage control, report to the first officer.
Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act.
With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy.
Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu.
Unable to ascertain, sir.
We'll handle them, sir.
You'd think they had people beaming down every day.
Yes. A fortress, perhaps. A castle.
It would seem so.
You are our visitors. Welcome, welcome. I am Ayelborne.
You are most welcome, my friend.
I would like to speak to someone in authority.
Oh, yes. Our council chambers are nearby. Please.
Of course, my friend. Our village is yours. Captain.
We have no defences, Captain, nor are any needed.
It is our way of life, Captain.
That doesn't seem likely.
Captain, a large number of Klingon vessels have just arrived.
They're opening fire.
That is correct, Captain. There is no danger.
Can you verify that?
If you had listened to me
We must be sure you are not harmed.
How does he know that?
So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect.
Captain, our phasers are gone.
Did you take them?
Yes, Captain. I took them.
I must ask you to return them.
They know that Vulcan is a member of the Federation.
What about the rest of you?
We shall continue as before. We have nothing to fear.
This is the ruling council?
He is Baroner, one of our leading citizens.
And he has no tongue?
I have a tongue.
I am Spock, a dealer in kevas and trillium.
He's no spy.
He's done nothing. Nothing at all.
You're here. There's nothing I can do about it.
We shall obey your regulations, Commander.
I need your obedience. Nothing more. Will I have it?
You seem to be in command.
Me? I don't want the job.
You are concerned?
He is my friend.
You are sure?
I don't understand.
And you're proud of it.
Are you sure you're all right?
Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience.
Not necessary, Commander. I understand you very well.
Or I will be killed.
That is exactly right. You will be killed.
I'll try and avoid it.
I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you.
I thought you might.
We'll receive no help from the Organians.
A very meritorious idea, Captain.
We're short of tools.
With a delayed action fuse.
You were right, Mister Spock. A most satisfactory display.
But that was violence.
Terrible to destroy.
How little you understand us, Captain.
What are you going to do with him, Commander?
You'll have a drink with me, Captain?
What do you want from me?
Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope.
We're nothing like you. We're a democratic body.
It will take a lot longer than that, Commander.
It's no use, Jim. There's no way out.
How much of the twelve hours do we have left?
Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual.
They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar.
And there are guards every few feet down the hall.
Is there really a choice, Captain? I offer you safety.
They will not come here, Captain. You may believe me.
How little you understand us, Captain.
Please do not concern yourself about them.
What happened to them?
Why, nothing happened to them, Captain. Nothing at all.
Don't you see I'm busy?
The two Federation prisoners. They're gone.
You mean they've escaped?
If you're lying to me.
Is that's all you can do, smile?
You are free, Captain.
I want to know how I'm free, and why.
Those are Klingon phasers. Take the door. Get down, gentlemen.
In the courtyard of my headquarters,
Did you hear them?
Yes, of course, Captain. But nothing has changed.
It would appear so, Captain.
But only two. More Organians will die.
I cannot tell you.
You mean you would actually use force?
It's entirely up to you.
Come on, Mister Spock, let's get out of here.
It is necessary. They may harm one another.
They will wait until darkness.
We will wait.
That's a pretty close approximation.
I endeavour to be accurate.
I'll take the one on the left. Fire.
It has begun.
It will be hard.
I cannot understand these people.
They know what death is, don't they?
They do not seem to be worried about anything.
I am to gather two hundred more.
Well, what are the odds now?
Just stay where you are, Commander.
I don't intend to kill you unless I have to.
You may be premature. There are many possibilities.
What is it, Spock?
What are you talking about?
We have put a stop to your violence.
You are stopping this? You?
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
My fleet, it's helpless.
What have you done?
You're talking nonsense.
It is being done.
No one has been killed, Captain.
No one has died here in uncounted thousands of years.
How to handle their interstellar relations! We have the right
What do you mean, beings like yourselves?
But is all of this possible?
A shame, Captain. It would have been glorious.
You've been most restrained since we left Organia.
We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt.
Damage control, report to the first officer.
Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act.
With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy.
Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu.

How to handle their interstellar relations! We have the right
What do you mean, beings like yourselves?
Maintain transmission pattern until we've established orbit.
I am saying they knew there was a risk.
We've established orbit, sir, and I've pinpointed a settlement.
But these people shouldn't be alive.
Is it possible that they're not?
What was the reason for the dispersal?
Mister Sandoval, we do have a mission here. Examinations, tests.
We'll try not to interfere with your work.
What exactly are we looking for anyway, sir?
What is it?
You've known the Vulcanian?
Did you love him?
If I did, it was important only to myself.
How did he feel?
There is no choice, Elias. He will stay.
That'll be all. Thank you very much.
No animals. That's peculiar.
I'd like to see the medical records on the expedition.
Yes, I thought you might.
He promised to throw away his shingle.
You'll find no weaklings here. Captain.
I have work to attend to myself, Captain.
Make your point.
No, but I'd like you to see this for yourself.
On my way.
That can be explained.
I missed you.
Logically, you should all be dead.
Emotions are alien to me. I'm a scientist.
Captain, it's entirely unnecessary. We're in no danger here.
What about your animals?
Captain, you stress very unimportant matters. We will not leave.
It's not much further.
You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.
It shouldn't hurt.
No, I can't. Please, don't!
Not like this. It didn't hurt us.
I am not like you.
I love you. I can love you.
You're being unreasonable.
No, I think we'll use a
We haven't seen them since we began our check.
I've never seen a dragon.
Yes, what did you want?
Yes, Captain. What did you want?
I don't believe I want to tell you.
No, I don't think so.
You don't think so, what?
I don't think so, sir.
Spock, report to me immediately.
Spock. The frequency is open, but he doesn't answer.
That didn't sound at all like Spock, Jim.
I didn't say that.
How will you find Spock?
What are you doing with those things, DeSalle?
I didn't want to, Jim.
Very well. Come with me.
Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu?
I can see the Captain is going to be difficult.
How many of those did you beam up?
Oh, must be nigh onto a hundred by now.
This is the Captain. Beam me up.
Lieutenant, put me through to Admiral Komack at Starfleet.
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. I can't do that.
Get back to your stations. Get back to your stations.
I said get back to your station.
This is mutiny, mister.
I've heard that word a lot lately. Perfect. Everything's perfect.
I'll bet you've even grown your tonsils back.
Who wants to counteract paradise, Jim boy?
Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down.
Captain, why don't you join us?
In your own private paradise.
The spores have made it that.
Where did they originate?
We have no need or want, Captain.
It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love.
We have what we need.
I'm going back to the ship.
Enterprise to Mister Spock.
Yes, Jim. What is it now?
I've joined you. I understand now.
Wonderful, Jim. When will you beam down?
What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting.
Do you want me to beam up a party?
Just a moment. It won't take long. Do you mind?
Ready to beam up, Jim.
Jim, I don't understand.
Captain, if you'll excuse me.
My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador.
Captain, please don't
You did that to me deliberately.
The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore.
It can be done.
Good. Let's get to work.
Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence.
That is quite logical, Captain.
Yes. Yes. I'm quite well.
Can I come aboard? I've never seen a starship before
Yes to both questions.
I'll be back shortly, Captain.
It was necessary.
As though somebody had put itching powder on their skin.
What do you think you're doing?
I said I was sorry.
More like you're clumsy.
If you hadn't gotten in my way
Come on. Break it up. Break it up.
But is all of this possible?
A shame, Captain. It would have been glorious.
You've been most restrained since we left Organia.
Maintain transmission pattern until we've established orbit.

If you hadn't gotten in my way
Come on. Break it up. Break it up.
Nothing, Captain. Hailing frequencies are open.
Have you received an answer to your message yet, Captain?
Are you sure?
Positive. It repeats over and over.
Is that supposed to mean something?
You will disregard that signal, Captain.
Mister Fox, it is their planet.
I'm quite prepared to take that risk.
You are. I'm thinking about this ship, my crew.
Kirk, what's this about you going down alone?
Not alone. I'm taking some security people with me.
It is my prerogative.
We'll do our best. Let's go.
Captain, I wish
You were warned not to come here.
It was for your own safety, Captain.
That is impossible.
Would you mind telling me why?
You're still at war?
We have been at war for five hundred years.
With whom are you at war?
It will not last long.
Don't you take shelter?
There is no shelter, Captain.
Oh yes, and we will retaliate immediately.
What is it?
A hit right here in the city.
Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock?
Tricorder readings. Radiation. Disturbances of any kind.
Fusion bombs, materialised by the enemy over their targets.
Kirk to Bridge. Scotty?
Yes, I see it. They were warned.
Just as it happened fifty years ago.
Computers, Captain. They fight their war with computers. Totally.
Computer don't kill a half million people.
Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical.
We have a high consciousness of duty, Captain.
There is a certain scientific logic about it.
I'm glad you approve.
I do not approve. I understand.
What has happened?
I have been sent to ask if you require anything.
Don't you understand? Our duty
Your duty doesn't include stepping into a disintegrator and disappearing.
Then how can you stand
No, I don't see that at all.
I tell you, we should have heard something by now.
We can't just sit here.
What would you suggest?
Would you have me open fire?
Mister Fox'll be glad to hear about that.
I don't know.
Negative. A close copy.
A voice duplicator?
Are you sure you can do it, Mister Spock?
Do your best.
What do we do now, Captain?
A disintegration machine.
So I would assume.
Mea. What do you think you're doing?
You're not going in there.
No you're not.
Please. All right, don't worry about me.
Mister Spock, that guard. I'll cover you.
All right, you people, clear out of the way.
What are you doing?
You can't do this.
You have taken defensive measures.
Of course, but
They're holding our Captain.
We have no proof of that.
I'm responsible for the safety of this ship.
Why did we come back here, Captain?
Are you that anxious to die?
You don't understand.
Will it reach the ship?
What are you going to do?
I believe you, but
Tell me what I want to know. Please.
Mister Anan, this is Robert Fox
A great honour, Mister Ambassador.
We have approached you openly
A mistake, Mister Ambassador. We are at war.
I'm giving orders that our attack be stopped.
Thank you. I thought perhaps it was all a mistake.
Mister Scott, disruptor beams are no longer hitting us.
He will be there, sir.
No, sir, I will not.
What did you say?
I know about your authority, but the screens stay up.
No, sir. I won't lower the screens.
That you can, sir, but I won't lower the screens.
Well, Scotty, now you've done it.
I didn't come to drink.
A very efficient weapon. I'm not afraid of using it.
My first impression was correct. You are a barbarian.
What do you want, Captain?
I want to contact my ship. Where are my communicators?
You take a lot of chances, Councilman.
If I were you, I'd think about saving my life.
Won't you have a drink, Captain?
And then we can discuss our differences.
Well, I had to see it to believe it.
That is true.
Why, thank you, Doctor. I've just won my fourth game.
Observe for yourself. Rook to king's pawn four.
Well, why are you just sitting there?
Transporter room, stand by. We're beaming down.
Counsel for the defence?
Objection! Counsel for the defence has rested his case.
Of what nature is this evidence?
I can't tell you, I'll have to show you.
Is saving an innocent man's career a theatric? i
Counsels will kindly direct their remarks to the bench.
Object! The witness would be making a conclusion.
What man aboard ship would it not be beyond?
And at the moment, you have no records officer.
I beg your pardon?
This court is by no means adjourned, Mister Cogley.
Captain, are you maintaining an engine crew aboard?
We hope to be finished long before that.
So Finney is alive.
What does that mean?
The orbit is beginning to decay.
Ben, where are you?
I'm glad you're alive.
Ben! Ben, it's not too late. We can help you.
What about my ship?
Mister Spock, what's our orbit status?
Variants at second level
Mister Spock, we're running out of time.
Gentlemen, if you'll please hurry to the transporter room
What do you mean?
She's on board by now. Yes. She's on board.
I didn't have much of a chance to thank him.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
And so must the Enterprise. Goodbye, Jim.
She's a very good lawyer.
Indeed she is.
What is it, Webb?
A blip, sir. Just came on the screen.
How do you read it?
What was the approach?
Directly over the Omaha installation, sir. Holding there.
Mister Scott is still with us.
Yes, sir. Helm answering. She's sluggish, sir.
Put it on audio.
Captain, I'm getting ground to air transmission.
Picking up, sir, but she's still slow in responding.
Aircraft is breaking up, Captain.
That's right. You can step off the transporter
Relax, Captain, you're among friends. I'm Captain James T. Kirk.
Kirk here. What is it, Mister Spock?
There are only twelve like it in the fleet.
Neither have I.
Captain Christopher, this is my First Officer, Lieutenant Commander Spock.
Very well, Mister Spock. Anything else on your mind?
Your logic can be most annoying.
Computer, you will not address me in that manner. Compute.
It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle.
I'm afraid you'll have to. We can't send you back.
I'd report, If I could. We can't take the risk.
Recommendation for his disposition, dear?
Captain Christopher. Captain Christopher? Security, this is the Captain.
Yes. But we're not in that position yet.
I'm glad to hear it.
Maybe he could be retrained, reeducated.
Now you're sounding like Spock.
If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave.
Could he be retrained to forget his family? His children?
It's just a joke, Captain.
You said you had some additional information, Mister Spock?
I made an error in my computations.
Oh? This could be an historic occasion.
Primitive computer. I've seen them demonstrated in museums.
I don't intend to start it.
How long have they been down there now?
Well, shouldn't they be coming up?
What was that?
What was what?
I didn't hear anything.
That noise. It's coming from one of these things.
Stay right where you are.
We'll know in a moment, Doctor.
Spock here. Are you all right, Captain?
I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain.
Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is.
We'll try the darkroom.
All right. Where's the other one?
No. Nobody should have been able to.
Your decision to beam up was quite correct, Mister Sulu.
Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me.
Don't try to be funny. How did you get in?
I popped in out of thin air.
No, Colonel. I know it's no game.
All right. What did you say your name was?
For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk.
I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Colonel, would you mind being careful with that?
Did I sabotage something?
Is that what you're here for? Nothing at all?
That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered.
That ought to be just about right.
I can't do that, Captain.
If something went wrong
In fact, I do. But only to a certain point.
Do they do that all the time?
Are you hungry?
What would you like?
Yes, I do. What's he doing here?
Don't be a fool. You know what's at stake.
You can't explain your presence on the base.
You'll go home, Christopher but you'll do it our way.
I suspected he might not wish to return with us.
Four to beam up, Mister Sulu.
It's maximum now, sir. She's fighting it.
We've broken free and heading back.
Bridge to transporter room. Captain Christopher.
We're coming up on Earth fast, Captain. Are you ready?
Twenty minutes, sir. It'll be close.
Bridge to transporter room. Prepare to energise.
You should be close enough for a visual contact.
We don't track mirages.
Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energise.
What's our reading, Mister Spock?
Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin now.
Bridge to engineering. Begin full braking power.
Fifty years to go.
Mister Scott is still with us.
Starfleet Control, this is the Enterprise. Captain Kirk speaking.
Starfleet Control, repeating message. The Enterprise is home. Kirk out.
You'll enjoy Commodore Travers. He sets a good table.
Good, Commodore. We're on our way.
We'll beam down immediately, Commodore. Kirk out.
Perhaps, Captain, but nevertheless
Doctor, you are a sensualist.
Kirk to Enterprise. Red alert.
Cestus Three has been destroyed.
Cover! Kirk to Enterprise, lock on transporters. Beam us up.
Captain, we're coming under attack. Unidentified ship quartering in.
Firing phasers, Captain. The alien has screens up, too.
Are you under attack, Captain?
We're helpless down here. And the Enterprise
Sulu is an experienced combat officer.
Can you remember the layout of this place? The arsenal?
I'll risk it.
Captain, are you all right?
Arm your photon torpedoes.
We can't get visual contact. She's too far away.
Clear, Captain, but you
Never mind about me. Protect my ship!
How is he, Doctor?
They're moving. I've got to get to the Captain.
Sulu's taken her out of orbit.
They got Lang, sir.
Did you see them?
An evaluation, Mister Kelowitz. Where do you think they are?
It'll be a lot closer to them. Stand clear.
Can you tell me what happened?
Orbit decaying, Mister Spock. Ten seconds to atmosphere.
Totally illogical. There was no chance.
That's exactly what I mean.
It's getting hot.
Mister Spock, you're a stubborn man.
Thank you, Yeoman. That's sufficient.
You need sleep, Captain. If it's not out of line
Have Doctor McCoy's report channeled to my quarters, Lieutenant.
I couldn't have prescribed better. We are one weary ship.
Do you think the Captain will authorise shore leave here?
He'd like it.
Oh, my paws and whiskers! I'll be late.
Thank you very much.
What is it? What's the matter?
Did you see them?
See what? I don't see anything. What is it, Doc?
Captain, are you beaming down?
I hadn't planned to, Bones. Why?
As a matter of fact, yes.
Very well, Captain. Something I did come to discuss.
Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?
That's much too low a rating.
Yes, sir. We've completed the specimen survey.
Negative. He was examining the flora at the time.
Bridge, this is the Captain.
Where is Mister Sulu?
Negative, Captain. They're just about to start.
You're cancelling the shore leave on account of this, Jim?
You're the doctor, Doctor. Can you explain this?
What do you think you're doing?
Where did you get it, Mister Sulu?
Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir. He must have gone through here.
Well, it could have been worse.
You could have seen the rabbit.
And you being the very serious young
Good. I've got a personal grudge against that rabbit, Jim.
Finnegan? I can't believe it.
All right, let's try that one again. Go!
What was it?
Barrows, give me a report.
Are you sure you're not imagining all this?
Sounds like Don Juan.
Mister Sulu was with you. Where is he now?
Stay with her, Doctor.
Jim, darling, it is me. It is Ruth.
It doesn't matter. None of that matters.
No, but I'm sure he's all right.
Yes, I'm fine.
Don't you like birds, Mister Rodriguez?
You have to go?
I don't want to.
You'll see me again if you want to.
You haven't told me. You haven't told me
Do what you have to do, and I'll be waiting.
Can you pinpoint the source?
A little, but I wouldn't want to be alone here.
It's a beautiful place. A little strange, I'll admit.
Doctor, I'm afraid.
All right, but you stay right there. Don't peek.
Right. What the devil's wrong with communications? Esteban. Esteban.
Any chance these could be hallucinations?
One hallucination flattened me with a clout on the jaw.
That sounds like a painful reality.
Captain, take cover! There's a Samurai after me.
That's not all. So's my phaser.
Good. We can use your help.
We're stranded down here, Captain?
Until we can find out what this is all about.
There's no one here.
Don't talk like that.
That way. Spread out. Let's find it.
It is, it is. I'm to blame.
It's like a dummy, Captain. It couldn't be alive.
Are you saying this is a plant, Mister Spock?
What is it?
Can it hurt us?
Not unless it makes a strafing run.
He's gone. Dragged off.
McCoy's death is a scientific fact.
I was, I was thinking about the Academy. My days
Finnegan. Finnegan! What's been happening to my people?
Take Sulu. Find McCoy's body. This man is my problem.
That's an order, Mister Spock.
Can you feel that?
Finnegan. One thing
Not bad. Kind of makes up for things, huh, Jim?
A lot of things. What's been happening to my people?
Did you enjoy it, Captain?
Which supports a theory I've been formulating.
Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about
Yes. We must all control our thoughts.
Who are you?
I'm the caretaker of this place, Captain Kirk.
Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through?
The term is amusement park.
Exactly, Captain. How very perceptive of you.
The ceremony will be carried on all viewing screens, sir.
There was a call for you from the Bridge.
Maintain course to outpost four. Keep me informed. Kirk out.
Our speed is now maximum, sir.
Position, eight minutes from Outpost four at this velocity, sir.
There can't be much doubt who's attacking, sir.
I had no idea that history was your specialty.
Their war, Mister Stiles. Not yours. Don't forget it.
Energise main phasers, Mister Styles. All weapons to full power.
All weapons to full power. Phaser control room.
Sir, regaining contact with Outpost four. Switching to speakers.
Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status?
Can you locate the intruder for us?
Lock us onto your screen.
Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range.
Trying to, sir. They don't acknowledge.
Position of the intruder, Mister Spock.
Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a moment.
Go to full magnification.
Screen is on full mag, sir.
I don't see anything. I can't understand it.
Continuing to challenge, sir. Still no response.
Don't you mean interception course, sir?
It's all right. It's all right.
A signal, Commander.
We have him. Move toward him.
Power on. Reverse course. He'll try to slip under us.
Place one with the debris. Proximity fuse.
More wreckage, sir, scattering across our path.
Debris on our scanners.
Captain to Sickbay.
Sir, my first assignment was in weapons control.
Still no sign of movement, Commander.
We've damaged ourselves. Our fuel reserve is gone.
And it is our duty to crush the Praetor's enemies.
I do not trust their Captain.
We will attack, but on my order.
Will you require assistance here?
This time, we'll handle things without your help, Vulcan.
Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Stiles!
What purpose will it serve to die?
Are you all right, Mister Spock?
I'm all right.
He is Kodos. I'm sure of it.
I did it to trap Kodos!
Kodos is dead.
Is he? Is anyone sure? A body burned beyond recognition?
Then let's reopen it. Jim, four thousand people were butchered.
Kodos is dead. I'm satisfied of that.
Give information on actor Karidian prior to Kodos' death.
No information available, Anton Karidian, prior to twenty years ago
A good empirical research scientist. Steady, reputable, occasionally brilliant.
With a very long memory.
The others are on the patio.
My father will be delighted, Mister. Mister?
We are honoured.
I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally.
An actor turning away his admirers? Very unusual.
Then I'll talk to Lady Macbeth.
So. Captain of the Enterprise. Interesting.
So, Lady Macbeth. Interesting. What's your next move?
Very impressive. Lenore. I'd like to see you again.
You don't have a schedule now, do you?
You mean leave? But I've only just arrived.
And you hate to overstay a welcome.
At the party, you were such a brash young man.
It's Tom Leighton. He's dead.
I don't know. I'll try and find out.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Can you do me a favour?
Transporter room, ready to beam up.
Ready to resume course, Captain.
Tell her to come up to the Bridge, Lieutenant.
How did you know this lady was coming aboard?
I'm the Captain.
Can't you make other arrangements?
It'd be a shame if that happened.
I appeal to you.
The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers.
I'll make a bargain with you, Captain.
What have you got to trade?
Special performance for the crew in exchange for a lift.
Then you'll do it?
May I inquire as to our course, Captain?
Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course.
Data on question submitted to personnel files.
I'm sending him back.
My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol.
It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard.
It occurred. I dismissed it.
Did you order the soft lights especially for the occasion?
It's very old.
You can count on it.
Tell me about the women in your world, Captain.
Tell me about it.
What would you like to know?
I've heard of it.
Unfortunately, he wasn't the first.
What has Karidian to do with it?
His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared.
You think Jim suspects he's Kodos?
Not me. I am down. In the engineering room.
I think his heart is sore.
What can I do for you, Riley?
Well, you're not, and I'll prove it to you.
I'll be back, though it takes forever
Where my heart is
How'd you like that, Riley?
You've got to pull him through.
I'm not sure I can.
Someone tried to poison him.
When I've finished logging it.
Will he make it?
He's got a good chance.
Can we predict the same for you, Captain?
All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it.
Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you.
Someone tried to kill him.
Could have been an accident.
It could happen.
I know what he's doing, and I don't like it.
It's his job, and you know it.
And you also know that nothing is proven.
I'm not. I'm interested in justice.
Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance?
Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum.
You can't stay.
Go on. Block off this section. Hurry. I'll find it.
I hoped you would have respected my privacy, Captain.
I am sorry to hear that.
Do you believe that I am?
You're an actor now. What were you twenty years ago?
I learn my parts very quickly.
Kodos, whoever he was
But he didn't. And history has made its judgment.
Who do I have to be?
I believe we have a match, Captain.
You've made your point, Doctor.
Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I'll go no further.
Speak. I am bound to hear.
Riley, get back to the Sickbay.
He murdered my father, and my mother.
I'm not wrong.
It's an order. Give me the weapon.
Now get back to Sickbay. Go on.
It's going beautifully. What is it? What's wrong?
What are you saying?
What have you done?
What had to be done. They had to be silenced.
All of them? All seven? More blood on my hands?
No Father, not anymore. I'm strong, Father. It's nothing.
Bright as a blade. Come with me, both of you.
The play is over. It's been over for twenty years.
Stop it, Father! You have nothing to justify.
I did it for you. I've saved you.
You cannot deny him his last performance!
You'll never get off the ship.
Caesar, beware the ides of March.
No, child! Don't!
Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain.
Whenever you're ready, Mister Leslie.
You're not going to answer my question, are you?
That's an answer.
And the images we've been seeing are
You're not speaking, yet I hear you.
It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help.
This is Rigel Seven.
Please, we must hide ourselves.
The Talosians controlled his brain.
Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.
But it's only a dream.
You have to kill him as you did here before.
What is it? Why have they stopped the images?
I demand to know why.
If you'll be patient, the answers to your questions
Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.
I can wear whatever you wish, be anything you wish.
You're a fool.
Perhaps if you asked me some questions I could answer.
How far can they control my mind?
But they try to trick me with their illusions.
War, thousands of centuries ago.
That's why it's so barren up there?
Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.
You said that if I answered questions
Why? Just to maintain a supply of zoo specimens?
Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?
And if I prefer
To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment.
That's very interesting.
Now to the female.
You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?
It became necessary to attract a mate.
First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy. Excellent.
Is it good to be home?
Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?
Nice place you have here, Mister Pike.
Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?
No! Let me finish!
We were the only ones transported.
It's not fair. You don't need them.
He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.
Picked her? For what? I don't understand.
Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.
It's not fair. I did what you asked.
Hold still, or I'll break your neck.
Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil.
I've had some samples of how good they are.
Your ship. Release me, or we'll destroy it.
It seems the Talosians have deserted you.
Gentlemen, a moment, please.
Guilty as charged.
Bridge to Commander.
As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing.
I want to contact our ship.
Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves?
What is that?
But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual cooperation.
Let's get back to the ship.
I can't. I can't go with you.
You see why I can't go with you.
This is the female's true appearance.
You'll give her back her illusion of beauty?
Mister Spock, the system is coming on again.
Oh, Jim, I just can't understand this.
If my first officer states he received a transmission from
When he was promoted to Fleet Captain.
About your age. Big, handsome man, vital, active.
What's his problem, Commodore?
Well, that's true of course.
She merely mentioned she knew you, sir.
You have something to report, Miss Piper?
With the flashing light, he can say yes or no.
Enterprise to Starbase. Request confirmation.
I have security clearance, Chief.
This is Mister Spock.
Stand by. We'll warp out of orbit in one hour.
How long will he live?
Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?
I don't read you at all, Jim.
He's also half human.
He would not make a false entry.
Well, what is it? Sickness? Injury? How bad is it?
With a half Vulcan science officer named Spock.
Commodore! Captain Pike, he's gone!
Mendez here. What is it?
The Enterprise knows where she's going, Mister Hansen.
Someone's trying to hail us, sir.
You have your orders, Mister Hansen. We'll make no contact.
Spock is headed for Talos Four, all right.
Lock on to sensors. Measure object now following the Enterprise.
Computed. Shuttlecraft is already past point of safe return.
Two hours of oxygen left.
Spock would have some logical reason for going there.
Maybe. Maybe he's just gone mad.
Computer control. Lock on to shuttlecraft following us.
Go to tape Abel Seven Baker. Execute instructions.
Is it the captain, Mister Spock?
Adequate, Doctor. I'll make no trouble.
All right, Captain. Locked on to you.
Transferring command to you, sir.
Accepting command. Where's Mister Spock?
In his quarters, under arrest.
His quarters, after what he's done, Lieutenant?
Unable to comply.
Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid.
Are your comments a part of the record, sir?
Yes, it's on the record.
Present your evidence. Screen on.
I cannot tell you at this time, sir.
That has nothing to do with it.
The meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain.
Steady as we go.
We aren't going to go, to be certain?
Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.
What makes you think I need one?
Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.
And I vote we do not. Deadlock, and since I'm
We've settled into orbit, sir.
Zero point nine of Earth.
MAN: They're men. They're humans.
The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon.
Yes, affirmative on the
I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
Their health is excellent, almost too good.
I, I don't understand.
You will. You're a perfect choice.
What is it?
Plead signal for you, sir. Go ahead, Uhura.
Sir, I respectfully decline.
It's a native of Capella Four, isn't it?
It is beautiful, but also very deadly.
Hard about, helmsman. Change course for twenty four mark seven.
Captain, that ship is not responding.
Captain, they are making visual contact.
Put it on the screen, Lieutenant.
I've never heard that language before.
No use, sir. She's refusing to answer.
Yes, Scotty, what is it?
Mister Arex, what is our speed?
Sir, I can't release the tractor beam.
What do you mean, Mister Sulu?
Go to manual override.
We are still starship personnel, Captain.
Aye, Captain. Our engines are almost gone.
Contact in thirty nine seconds. Thirty eight, thirty seven
Thirteen, twelve, eleven
Get ready to execute course change, Mister Sulu.
Impossible. It should have been destroyed instantly.
It's got to work.
Fourteen seconds, thirteen, twelve
Never mind, Mister Spock, it's no use.
Where are we?
Yes, Scotty. How are we doing down there?
The alien ship is responding to our call, Captain.
We have little choice.
That would take a remarkable coincidence, Mister Spock.
May I introduce my son, Karl Four.
Then the young child in the playpen
That's true, Captain.
You are welcome to use my ship, Captain.
we just might get you to Babel after all, Commodore.
We're meeting the speed of Karla Five's unmanned vessel, Captain.
How is our course, Mister Sulu?
He's too young, Captain.
Yes, Captain, but who will fill in for you?
What do you mean?
I see what you mean.
Tractor beam? How do we do that, Spock?
Whatever you say. What shall I do?
You are correct, of course. Commodore April, command is yours.
Commodore? I'm Captain April, Mister Spock.
Very good. Assume your post at the navigation console.
Vessel armed, Captain. Nine seconds to impact. Eight, seven,
But the Enterprise crew, they're all children.
I see your flower has blossomed again.
If you would be so kind, Captain.
Slaughter? Hundreds of people?
Let me see that.
That doesn't mean he was responsible for it.
His trial will tell, Captain.
Trial? You mean kangaroo court. I've heard about Dramian justice.
Captain, you're becoming emotional.
Or a tragic mistake on my part.
I don't buy that, Bones. Guard!
There it is.
You are sure?
Estimated time of arrival, Mister Sulu?
Shall I make contact, sir?
You're planning something, Captain?
Unless I miss my guess, that's friend Demos.
What if he attacks, sir?
But the hangar doors aren't open, Captain.
I demand that you report to the Federation now!
I would, but unfortunately we're out of communications range.
You are a stowaway, Commander.
I have been tricked.
You're sure it's safe, Captain?
Decidedly. There's a difference, Captain.
Not the most enchanting place I've ever been to.
Plagues seldom leave behind fields of flowers, Captain.
They do not like outsiders.
Surely you're not an outsider, Commander. You're Dramian.
Inhospitable or not, he mustn't get away.
He's disappeared. It's almost as if he dematerialised.
I would advise against that, Captain.
I'm sure you won't mind if I ignore your advice.
Caution would seem to be advisable, Captain.
Bones' life is on the line, Mister Spock.
Cave dwellers? In the midst of your civilisation?
A result of your Doctor McCoy and his inhumane methods.
You say it, Demos, but that doesn't
But how did he survive the plague?
Then you can tell us. Do you remember?
Let's get underway for Dramia.
Sir, who is that?
I'll pour on the coal, Captain.
Let's hope the trial hasn't started.
Yes, Mister Spock. What is it?
He's hardly fit to testify at the trial, Captain.
We've got to save him.
It is not that. It is
Captain, you're blue.
General Order Six has been activated?
Good. Report to Sickbay, Mister Sulu.
But sir, who will monitor?
I assure you I am capable, Mister Sulu.
We have to get McCoy. Must find an antidote.
Impossible. He too is stricken.
Got to get McCoy.
Doctor, just come with me, please.
Plague? Why didn't you tell me?
I'm a doctor, Spock, a doctor. Get us beamed aboard.
Blast it, Spock, work harder. They're in the terminal stage.
Bones, that's it. Aurora, changing colour.
Jim? Aurora? What
Bones, you did it!
And we'll forget about a certain stowaway.
We must apologise.
What is that supposed to mean?
Hippocrates would not have approved of lame excuses, Doctor.
Captain, I've established contact with the Romulan commander.
I demand an explanation for this unprovoked attack.
Strange. It's not on the charts.
Mister Spock, what are our chances?
After that ride, I could use some repairs.
How are the repairs progressing, Scotty?
How do you like that? So did mine.
I'm beginning to wonder, Bones, I am beginning to wonder.
What have you got there, Spock?
I'm sorry, Spock, it's your
Officer Scott, won't you join us for lunch?
Hey, wait a minute. We didn't cause this to happen.
Okay, this whole thing has gone far enough!
When you all finish laughing, I'd appreciate an explanation.
Captain, I never laugh.
This is no joke, sir.
Amazing. This deck is covered with ice.
The evidence all points to one guilty party, Captain.
You mean you know who's behind these stunts?
Well, what'll it be, a swim at the beach?
Then woods it is.
Ah, now that's more like it. Shall we?
That's strange. Repeat the call.
It's so peaceful. So relaxing.
And best of all, no practical jokes.
What was that?
I'm not sure. It almost sounded like someone chuckling.
There it is again. Someone is definitely laughing at us.
Did I hear that right?
I'll never tell.
Well, I'll be
I suggest compliance, Captain.
Say pretty please with sugar on.
Temper, temper. Perhaps this will cool you off.
Time for a nap, old girl. Captain's orders.
Vacate sir? But
You bloody big scatterbrain. Make up your monumental mind.
What can we do to stop it?
I cannot define the field's energy base, Captain, but
Tchar. In the name of the Seven Gods, why?
Now you can fly and fight as a Skorr.
No offence, little ones, but let me tackle him.
Last week with you, Captain.
Call for retrieval, now.
Let me die.
You're going back with us.
What about Tchar? How are you going to punish him?
What do you mean?
How long were we gone?
Long? About two minutes, I guess. I don't understand.
It was against all orders.
The need was apparently desperate.
You Vulcans are the most impossible, unimaginative
Bones, that's not helping the situation.
According to their lot, they beamed down six weeks ago.
Careless of me, Mister Spock. Planetary life forms?
Jim, if the others are lost, why take the risk?
It's still a risk.
Then we'll beam back up.
It may be able to navigate on land.
I know it can.
Let's get out of here.
Strange you didn't get a voice reply.
There could be many reasons why we did not.
Concentrate on the underside of the neck.
I am undamaged. Where is Doctor McCoy?
We'll get you out, Bones.
Thanks. The air was running out under there.
Were you hurt?
Captain, the beast, did it seem familiar to you?
My shoes are full of sand.
Doctor, your lack of scientific interest is amazing.
I've seen stranger things, Mister Spock.
Kirk to Enterprise.
I don't know. But at least they're alive.
Apparently alive. We cannot be sure.
I choose to believe they are.
Allow me to test the water first, Doctor.
Captain, the water is too pure.
Nonetheless, it is too pure.
In other words, it's too good to be true.
Terraforming isn't new. It implies intelligent life forms.
Unless, of course, the random choice is the pattern.
Spock, do you ever say anything straight out?
Gentlemen, please. We have work to do.
We're still alive, aren't we?
If that's true, Spock, then
We've been travelling for hours. Where are they taking us?
Captain, there it is.
That must be five square kilometres.
If these are the builders, it is an admirable feat.
Congratulations, Doctor. A most logical assumption.
And we are definitely on the inside.
Surely we can communicate with them some way.
You mean it's some kind of a zoo?
Or maybe they want to see how our toys work.
That too is a possibility.
We've got to communicate with them.
Well, so much for mythology.
This is real grass.
A zoo? I'm no animal.
We've been expecting you.
We heard your communicator signal.
Then why didn't you warn us?
There were six of you on the mission.
I'll check her out. Maybe I can help.
What have you learned about the aliens?
Have you tried an escape?
Have you tried to communicate?
We seem to have company.
You seem to be getting a response.
My impression is that they are laughing at me.
Captain Kirk, Mister Spock, this is Nancy Randolph, our navigator.
How is she?
The Lactrans outside, what do they do?
Do they feed us or do we shift for ourselves.
Always to the same place?
Then my equipment should be there.
Then think about it that way, Doctor.
Food. But it's not feeding time.
It's all here. They haven't damaged it.
What's your evaluation of the situation, Markel?
A natural reaction for the curators of a zoo.
How? We can't get through to them?
They communicate telepathically.
Between themselves, yes, but, Mister Spock, aren't Vulcans telepathic?
How much have you learned?
What's their impression of us?
How about coming up with another move, then?
Aye, and where is that tricky devil?
Scanners indicate the Enterprise shields are totally depleted, sir.
Sir, our weaponry is frozen.
Welcome to Elysia. Devna, Interpreter of Laws.
How did you freeze my weaponry?
We are getting out.
Then we'd better do it pretty quick, Captain.
If we find an answer, it will still take time.
That's just what we haven't got.
It's our dilithium crystals, sir. They're deteriorating rapidly.
Got any miracles in your computer, Spock?
Impossible to predict, Captain.
What do you see beyond your eyes, Magen?
Gently, good Magen. Return to us now.
It is impossible.
Have you covered every possibility? Every factor?
Jeopardising his crew and his ship unnecessarily?
But this involves combining our ship with the Klothos.
That is correct.
Good. I'll contact Kor right away.
What is it?
It is not against our laws to try to escape.
Even if they die?
It is their choice.
Forgive me, Commander. I was overcome by the moment. Goodbye.
The stories of his being half human must be true.
Perhaps the time continuum affected his mind.
I wonder if we all haven't become affected.
I would think my commander had manoeuvred brilliantly.
And it can be arranged, practically speaking?
Beg your pardon, sir.
What is it, Gabler.
We were lost.
Jim, I'm worried about Spock. He's just not acting normal.
He's under a lot of pressure, Bones.
I'll talk to him, Bones. It's all I can do.
Yes, Captain. Why do you ask?
You have the device, Kaz?
You could go. We're willing to take passengers.
We believe it can be done.
Then I shall not interfere with your dream, Captain.
Get away from here, human. This is my woman.
You will fail.
You would take these renegades with you?
We need them.
Ready to accelerate to warp six.
Enterprise, this is Xerius! Come in, Enterprise.
Sir, Xerius is calling us. He says it's urgent.
It will go off when you reach warp eight.
There it is, sir.
It doesn't matter, Bones.
That's what matters.
Arachna is entering its cycle of strongest emissions, Captain.
Put it on the speaker.
Signals appear random. Perhaps some are beyond our reception capability.
Could be a natural radio source newly energised by
Intersat? That's been out of use for two centuries.
No, sir. It was repeated twice in the transmission.
Mister Sulu, lay in a course for Cepheus.
It's a waste of time if you ask me.
Set for a single elliptic orbit.
Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, how are your engines?
Purring like happy kittens, Captain.
Nothing, Jim. The gossamer mice show no signs of shock.
Don't know yet.
But dilithium molecules are the hardest, most rigid
Mister Scott! More trouble with the circuit work.
You sound like you're blathering, man. Wait, I'm coming.
Spock, are you slumping?
Captain, the most incredible thing is happening.
We know. The whole ship has apparently expanded.
Only that it is complex beyond anything in my experience.
Kirk here. How are they holding out, Scotty?
Kirk to Sickbay.
Bones, I need some answers. What's happening to us?
There's the test tissue, Jim, compared with the stable infrared.
Then Spock's theory is right. We're contracting.
Agreed. And it is accelerating.
How long can it keep on?
Miss Chapel, what is the composition of this decoration?
Aren't all our uniforms xenylon?
Yes, and they've all been shrinking proportionately with us.
That means only organic matter is affected. But how?
The strands wouldn't break, Jim, they'd just quit winding.
Then we can calculate the limits to our shrinkage.
It's possible. I'll feed the data into the computer banks.
Spock, how small will we ultimately shrink?
Sulu! I think his leg's broken. We'll need a splint.
Let's get him to Sickbay. Every one back to stations.
It's certainly worth a try.
It's in the lab shelf supplies. I'll get it.
No more climbing heights for you, Nurse. Got that clear?
Yes, Captain. But I've also got the miniature laser.
How is it, Sulu?
I can feel it knitting, sir.
Results on DNA reduction limits have come through, Captain.
What are they?
Factor of thirty two point nine.
Yes, Captain. Well past the operative point of Enterprise controls.
It's as good a place as any to beam down.
Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, can you hear me?
I think I see
Scotty, is it you?
Captain, you'll deafen us for sure!
You forbid me after what you've done to my people?
Where are my officers?
Spock, who are the Terratins? Where'd they come from?
Bridge crew, prepare to beam up.
Subspace radio now operational, sir. Starbase Twenty Three is reading.
Mister Arex, prepare for immediate departure from this area.
We came rather close to making it more than honorary.
Do you think Harry Mudd is down there, Spock?
Why can't you just say, Mudd's probably there.
I just did, Doctor.
Harry, darling. I was lonely for you.
Please, darling, come back to the ship with me.
Three hundred credits, or the
I surrender myself with free will. Mercy of the law.
Fine. I'll see you in court, Harry.
A minor bruise, Captain. He'll live.
And came here to swindle honest miners.
Your Mister Spock is really a very attractive intelligence.
What is it?
Think about it, darling. Mister Spock in love with you.
I'll let you know the results of my analysis.
What is it?
A temporary effect as the liquid is absorbed.
I feel better.
Didn't I tell you?
You should, you should be in the Brig, Harry.
Oh, right you are, darling.
Are you injured, Miss Chapel?
No. No, I, I'm fine. Are you feeling all right?
Wouldn't you like me to, well, stay? Help you?
That would be illogical, Miss Chapel.
Yes. Yes, It'd be stupid.
Harry Mudd, you swindling
I've come to collect on your guarantee, Mister Mudd.
You're implying the potion was not completely successful?
Put it on screen.
Mudd. And he has Christine. She's in danger. My love.
He's going planet side.
No. Not with my Christine.
Spock, you're obviously not yourself. Maybe some rest.
Then I'll transport down with you.
Jim, is that wise, in his condition?
Jim, the search party found this in the shuttlecraft bay.
One of Mudd's love crystals.
Lucky for us they don't work.
Check it out, Bones. Send me an immediate report.
Well, I hadn't planned on it.
Thanks Jim. It's good to have a friend like you.
Darling, are you all right?
Kirk, get us out of here.
They're not responding.
Don't worry. You'll be safe, darling.
They're coming closer.
That's my affair.
I think we should get a few things straight.
Yes, we have to control our emotional reactions.
How long does the effect of the potion last, Harry?
Harry, do you have any of the crystals left?
I made contact.
May I help you record his confession, Nurse?
You? You'd be the last person I'd choose.
I can guarantee it.
Yes, just as beautiful as I remembered it. Nothing's changed.
Thank you so very much.
It's hard to believe they're not real.
Lovely. They just don't make them like that anymore.
Off with his head. Off with his head!
Uhura to Transporter room. What is the emergency? Respond, please.
I see. Bones, were you thinking about that book?
Mister Sulu, did you experience any strange occurrences?
His quarters are somewhere underground, aren't they?
Any indication of where that would be?
You are being detained so your master will not leave.
That is your name for it.
Why do you think the Enterprise is my master?
Your questioning is redundant.
That is a word meaning to cease to function?
This planet is built like a fortress.
Enterprise, do you read me?
Scott to Bridge. Beam down of phaser bore commencing.
Scott to Bridge. We've got problems.
There's an inscription, several languages.
Well, gentlemen, it appears that we're on our own now.
Programmes have been changed before, Lieutenant.
Please believe me. There's no reason to harm them.
They serve the sky machine, but they are not essential.
Oh, but they are. They're most essential.
Do not attempt to disconnect me.
You sound less than enchanted with your function.
It's fighting us. There must be a faster way.
What do you want, signs pointing the way?
Doctor, I only meant it seems like we're wasting time.
I'm sorry, Sulu. I'm worried about Uhura.
Phasers are dead! Run for the cave!
Our amusement park no longer seems content to amuse.
Please, call off that beast. Why are you doing this?
Mister Arex, what are you doing?
I believe you may know the answer to that, Doctor.
Me? What are you talking about?
And whether it wants to or not.
Perfect, Bones. Which arm do you want?
I submit, Captain, that I am the more qualified subject.
My knowledge of computers for one thing.
And his tough Vulcan hide for another.
Both your arguments seem sound. Go ahead, Bones.
I believe you will find ten cc's adequate.
It's been almost five minutes, Captain.
It looks like some kind of mechanical nursemaid.
Not in my wildest dreams would I think of that!
We have a visitor.
We've got to make those rocks. It's our only chance.
I presume you are the planet's master computer.
What happened to the Keeper?
He was old. He ceased to function.
Sky machines? Slaves? What are you talking about?
A new computer!
It's a dead end!
You are masters of the sky machine?
This is a shock.
Mister Scott, all systems are now functioning normally.
We must have more of these discussions while you're here.
Mister Spock, would you care to take on that duty?
I would find it most interesting, Captain.
Then it's agreed. Kirk to Enterprise.
Reverse power. Hold our position. Deflector screens on.
Deflectors up. Sir, it's taking considerable power to hold position.
Everything can be repaired, Captain.
An incredible experience, Captain. I find this scientifically fascinating.
We'll ride her through, Bones. What else can we do?
Ride her through where?
Where are we?
Captain, the subspace radio. It's dead.
Even the ship's chronometers have stopped.
Ship's life support systems fading. Jim, we need oxygen.
Jim, we've got to do something.
Ah, humans. Lovely primitive humans. Can't you do anything right?
Everything is working, my friends.
It cannot. It is not logical.
Look around you, Spock. Everything is working.
Welcome! I knew eventually humans would come searching for me.
Who are you?
I find this all quite absorbing, Doctor.
Probably because you're not very natural to begin with, Spock.
Children will play.
Our universe operates by what you superstitiously call magic.
I know this is just my imagination but
A love philter?
What is it? What's wrong?
Captain Kirk, what
Everyone onboard is all right?
Mister Scott, I'm bewildered, that's all. But that's enough.
If Lucien put it there
Weapons status, Mister Scott? We may have to protect ourselves.
Forget it, Spock. It won't work.
What are you doing?
Learning to protect ourselves, Lucien.
But you made mistakes, used your powers
And burned for it. Burned!
And loneliness and fear
I will, Asmodeus. I am not of Earth.
Yes, you are different. The court will hear a defence.
I call Lucien as my first witness.
Indeed, Captain. Could you elaborate?
Submit, Captain. You haven't the power to fight us.
Captain, use the magic you know. Believe.
I don't understand.
All systems go, Captain. We're back to normal.
Does it really matter?
Life readings are confused, sir. I can't decipher them.
What is it, Mister Sulu?
You're going to have to see this yourself, sir.
What is that thing?
Ow! Must have been a thorn.
He's been poisoned. Unknown toxin.
Can you help him?
I can't get a correlation with any known poison.
That won't be necessary.
Who are you?
I am called Agmar. I believe we can help.
Are you getting a reading on them?
A moment, Captain. The results are unclear.
Captain, these beings are of botanical origin.
So it would seem.
Welcome to the planet Phylos.
What happened to him?
A minor achievement.
There have been humanoid aliens here before.
Your method of communication
Come. I will show you.
We had no way of knowing what was happening.
You were alive then?
They won't work on any setting, sir.
I think it's after you, Jim.
Kirk to Enterprise.
What do you think they'll do with us, sir?
I'm sorry, Captain Kirk, but there was no other way.
What are you talking about? Where have they taken Spock?
Where is Spock?
Not without my First Officer.
Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up, Scotty.
I'd hate to resort to clubs and knives.
Aye, sir, but I don't like it.
Neither do I, but it appears to be necessary. Energise.
I'm not sure I can take too much of this.
I can't believe it.
Looks like they're getting ready to go on a trip.
Agmar said they were a peaceful people.
Sure they are, now. But what about before?
Any indication of Keniclius or Spock?
Carry on your work?
What if something happens to Spock or the Master?
Just like that, Captain?
The way is though here, gentlemen.
Did you hear something?
I'm not sure.
Not much further now, Captain.
They don't operate. Agmar!
I see it. I see it. Keep going.
He's dying. Something's happened to his brain. Electrical activity decreasing.
Captain, I'm out. The chemical sprayer is empty.
Out of my way, mister. That's an order.
It's no use, Mister Scott. I can't get through.
That's our ship calling, Spock. You answer them.
Spock is slipping away. There isn't much time left.
I'm sure we're getting through, but they're not acknowledging.
That's what I call close, Mister Scott.
Let's hope it was information they could use.
No! The mould must be broken.
SPOCK: I do not believe so.
No! Our dream must not be allowed to die.
Murderer! You've killed Spock!
Spock. Spock, you old
I would be honoured. If I will be allowed.
Inscrutable? Sulu, you're the most scrutable man I know.
Have you identified the vessel, Mister Spock?
That's impossible, Spock. Carter Winston's been missing over five years.
Incredible. It is him.
It seems you gentlemen know me.
My fiancee? Anne's aboard this starship?
Spock is right as usual, Bones.
Are you suggesting I'm not quite human, Doctor?
The Captain is inquiring if the examination is completed, Doctor.
Yes, I suppose so.
I'm sorry, Anne. I never thought we would meet again.
Carter, what is it?
But you did survive. You're alive, and we're together again.
I hope I'm not intruding, Captain.
No, please come in, Mister Winston.
Weren't you going to your cabin, sir?
Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three.
That was the order, helmsman.
An admirable mission, Captain, but if we endanger our ship
That has been his reputation.
You have the conn, Mister Spock.
I'll take the conn, Mister Spock.
I believe that was the reason you gave, Captain.
Perhaps Doctor McCoy should examine you, Captain.
Doctor, what do I do? I still love him.
I haven't. What can I do?
What can I do for you, Captain?
I want a complete medical examination, Bones. Something's just happened
There are not many places one could hide in here.
I must have taken a little nap.
There's something wrong about this room.
I don't think so, Doctor.
I saw that, but I don't believe it.
Spock to Bridge. Put me on ship's audio.
Anne, what are you doing?
Lieutenant Nored, you could've stopped him. Why didn't you fire?
Bridge, this is the Captain. What's happened?
It was not deliberate, I assure you.
I'd like a few minutes to inform my crew.
It would seem so.
I will not surrender my ship.
What are you doing?
Captain, our deflector shields are coming down.
Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, what's happened to the shields?
Mister Scott isn't here, sir.
We need him. Override the controls and shut those doors.
How long will it take to fix?
Carter? What did he say?
How did he die?
You are so much like him, his voice, his mannerisms.
He did say he loved me.
But unfortunately, I can't.
Without deflectors, we're just a clay pigeon for them.
Practicality does suggest capitulation, Captain.
Captain, the deflector shields are coming up again.
That's only one shield.
Yes, sir, but it is between us and the Romulans.
Will someone tell me what's going on?
What manner of beastie is that?
I assume the danger to your ship is over.
Why did you do it?
What changed your mind about the Romulans?
What will happen to me now?
Captain, could you assign me that duty.
But you've seem me. You know what I am.
I don't know. I
You have the guard detail, Lieutenant.
They're firing on him.
They got him.
Scotty, have you got that pilot yet?
Our engines are dead.
The phasers don't work, sir.
Well, we could always throw rocks.
Scotty, did you get that pilot?
But I can't integrate him. The system's been discoordinated.
Captain, I have a message coming in, sir.
Put it on the viewscreen.
Release my ship.
What was that? Lieutenant, cut off that frequency.
They still have power? We still control them?
Captain, you can't afford to lose that grain.
Incredible. The amount of energy that field must require.
They couldn't maintain the stasis field.
Apparently their battle capacity is down. They only damaged it.
They're veering off.
Scotty, can you integrate that pilot now?
I think so, Captain.
Call McCoy to the Transporter room. Spock.
Have you got him?
It appears to be
I don't want to think about it.
And he's got tribbles with him. Tribbles!
Captain, these are safe tribbles.
There's no such thing as a safe tribble.
Well, at least it's neat.
Why were the Klingons chasing you, Jones?
How should I know? Klingons have notoriously bad tempers.
They did mention ecological sabotage.
Me? A saboteur? Ridiculous.
Captain Koloth was pretty emphatic.
What did you do?
Well, I didn't know it was a Klingon planet.
Captain, couldn't we talk this over? I didn't think so.
He really doesn't seem the saboteur type, Jim.
Captain, sensors are picking up a Klingon battle cruiser.
Captain Koloth is quite a marksman.
They've changed course. They're coming in again.
Perhaps they haven't had enough time to recharge it.
Or the purpose of the attack was something else.
Well, Mister Spock, do you have any ideas?
We could always throw tribbles at them.
I thought Vulcans didn't have a sense of humour.
We don't, Captain.
Any sign of Captain Koloth's ship?
Mister Jones, you are in enough trouble already.
Captain, a harmless little tribble. What can they hurt?
They're hungry, Captain.
Captain, the Klingons are coming back.
Speak of the devil.
Jim, there's something about these tribbles.
That's done it. We're caught.
Not if I can help it.
Aren't you going to sit down, sir?
I think I'll stand.
Mister Scott, we're going to implement Emergency defence plan B.
You don't know yet, do you?
You must have others.
Jones sold before they completely overrun the planet.
And that's all you want?
We must have the glommer.
I withdraw my claim.
Captain, the engine room is filled with tribble.
Five seconds. Four, three
Put it on ship's speaker.
It's more like music than a message.
Captain, we are being probed.
From where? Can you trace it?
Can you identify it?
It seems to be calling us.
Strange. Yes, I get the same feeling myself.
It does resemble a summons.
I find no resemblance to a summons, Captain.
You wanted me, Lieutenant? Are you all right?
Logically, we must assume they are created by the probe.
Sir, what visions? We don't see anything.
Miss Chapel, you don't see anything, either?
No, I don't think so, Carver. Spock will do it.
There is something compelling about it.
Yes, I feel it too, Bones.
There's no apparent danger, Spock. Let's go.
They are here.
Oh, such wondrous ones. They honour us.
How do you know our names?
The signal? A distress call, wasn't it?
Take them to the slumber chambers. They must rest.
Probably that nectar. It's potent as Saurian brandy.
Summation of medical, biological, astrophysical scans.
Lieutenant Uhura to Security Officer Davison.
What are you doing?
Taking command of this ship.
We must return to our duties aboard ship.
Yes. Duties. That's it. Duties. I have
We must go.
Very thoughtful of you, love.
I wonder why they let me keep it.
Perhaps they saw no practical use in it.
Cortropine. Could help. It's a strong stimulant.
The urn. It's the only place.
They are not here, Theela.
You mean they're actually draining our life forces?
How long do we have, Spock?
We seem to be aging ten years per day, Captain.
Ten years? In four days, we'll be dead!
Spock to Enterprise.
Greetings. I am Theela. Head Female of this compound.
Return to your ship. You are not wanted here.
Until we find Captain Kirk, we will not leave.
Search the temple. Parties of two.
No sign of them anywhere.
What is it?
It is Spock. There must be a panel somewhere.
We've got to get out of here.
We tried that.
Wait! I will tell you everything.
We shall see. The men of the Enterprise, reveal them.
They're drowning! Where are they?
The nearest water accumulation is many cusecs from here.
That looks like a pool or a tub.
It is the urn in the garden.
No results, Captain. We've tried everything we know.
Perhaps the transporter is the key.
Key to what?
But this has never been done before. Suppose it fails?
Scotty, we're losing them!
Did it work?
You're more handsome than ever.
Tell Captain Kirk we have kept the agreement.
How quickly will we become as other women?
Doctor McCoy says it should only take a few months.
Captain, we are now approaching sensor range of the cloud.
Put up our present position, Lieutenant Arex.
Captain, Alondra has disappeared from navigation scan.
The cloud could have come between us and the planet.
Spock, is it possible the cloud consumes planets?
Sir, the cloud is changing course.
But if it continues on that course
How much time do they have?
It's certain there'd be planetwide panic.
Who's the governor of Mantilles, Jim?
Captain, I'm getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors.
It's still got us.
Prepare to fire all phasers into cloud mass.
Firing. No effect, Captain
The cloud appeared to absorb the phaser energy, Captain.
We're floating inside the cloud.
The objects are some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter.
Scotty, prepare the shields for an antimatter charge.
Transfer it to my quarters.
You have time to save some people, Bob.
How are you going to choose?
We've reached the entrance to the central core, Captain.
What do we do now, knock?
What are those things?
How much time do we have?
Increase deflector shields to maximum.
Screens to maximum, sir.
Scotty, we've got ten minutes left.
The force field is holding. Let's go.
Where is the brain located?
Captain, this is a living creature. Starfleet regulations
I believe that is what I just said, Doctor.
Kirk to Engineering.
Incoming message, sir. It's Governor Wesley of Mantilles.
Put it on the viewscreen, Lieutenant.
Thirty one minutes and four seconds to Mantilles, sir.
Bob, where's Katie?
Don't worry, Bon. She'll be all right. Goodbye.
Can you do it in time?
Twenty six minutes exactly to Mantilles, sir.
The procedure is ready, sir.
How near is Mantilles, Mister Arex?
Awaiting your order, Captain.
The cloud has stopped, sir.
Spock, you did it! The cloud is leaving.
Mister Sulu, let's get out of here, through that grid.
Spock, what did you perceive?
The wonders of the universe, Captain. Incredible, completely incredible.
The travellers are returning.
What do you mean, who's he? You know Mister Spock.
Afraid I don't, Jim.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Who are you?
No, but if it's reality, what happened?
But something was changed.
Did you also research the Vulcan family history requested?
That is not correct.
It is in this case.
Twenty to thirty Vulcan years past.
The date was
The twentieth day of Tasmeen.
How do you know this?
This cousin, what was his name?
Spock, did Selek look like you do now?
I hear all.
It is possible if no other major factor is changed.
Andorians are not known for their charity.
The time and place are ready to receive you.
SPOCK: That is not true. My father
Peace and long life. You are of my family?
I am honoured. Is something wrong, Cousin?
A family resemblance to our forefathers, no doubt.
You seem to understand him better than my husband.
But tomorrow is the twentieth day of Tasmeen.
I seem to have lost track of time.
Sarek, our son and the visitor are gone.
You don't think he'd harm Spock?
It was my duty, Spock.
SPOCK: Mother says you should always say thank you.
The lady Amanda is known for her graciousness.
I dare say you will. Come now.
That is your father's wish?
SPOCK: How did you know?
SPOCK: Is he dying?
SPOCK: I can bring a healer here.
The hour is late. I trust your errand is urgent?
You are Spock, son of Sarek, are you not?
SPOCK: Healer, please hurry.
It will not be long now, old friend.
A Vulcan would face such a loss without tears.
SPOCK: Is there nothing you can do?
I trust you can explain why it was necessary?
The traveller is returning.
I sent the others up to the ship. What happened?
One small thing was changed this time. A pet died.
Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up.
Stand by to reverse course.
Captain, that's the source of the radio emissions.
Captain, we're still gaining speed.
No good, sir. We're still falling toward it.
How much time do we have?
Captain, there's another signal. Listen.
Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu. Maintain orbit.
Slingshot effect, Mister Spock? Do we have enough power?
I'll need some time for the computations, Captain.
It's coming from that ship, Captain.
You're sure, Mister Spock?
Mister Spock, any indication of that ship's power source?
A lighter and stronger material than anything we have now.
Look, every pod, they've all been burst open.
Aye, from the inside, from the looks of them.
Must have been some accident to get almost every pod.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Negative, Captain. It stopped transmitting when you beamed aboard.
What do you make of it, Spock?
Gives me the creeps. I feel like something's watching us.
I feel it too, Captain.
Enterprise, do you read me? Sulu?
We can cut our way out of here.
You mean we're trapped here? No communication, nothing?
Something to shield this room. But shield it from what?
Possibly from whatever had come aboard their ship.
Quite right, Mister Scott. No known form of life.
Will it hold?
What is it?
I'm not sure, but I think
A message from three hundred million years ago?
I may be able to get a translation.
Get out of here! Hurry!
Piece of cake, sir. Here they come now.
Captain, something's beamed aboard with you.
Transport it back out.
Sickbay reports no injuries to crew, sir.
No damage to hull or engines, Captain.
Like the beating of a heart.
Bridge to Sickbay.
Something's jammed the circuits. They're magnetised.
I thank you, sir.
Phaser banks were off, Captain. They activated themselves.
And mutual override did not work?
Sir, we cannot get into the core.
Drained of all energy, sir.
It would have a very small field.
It's activated, Captain, but only an area three metres square.
Do you get a magnetic flux reading there now?
It has absorbed the memory banks, Captain, all of them.
All nonessential systems are extinguished. You will obey me.
Stop! You'll hurt him.
I'll obey. Let him go.
I'm all right, Captain.
What are we dealing with, Spock?
That's the heart of the galaxy, Captain.
I'm aware of that, Mister Spock.
Auxiliary controls ready to activate, Captain.
The auxiliary warp drive controls can only be operated manually.
That is correct. You will activate the manual controls. Obey!
Standby to activate warp drive unit.
Is it gone?
Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector.
The Intrepid is manned by Vulcans, isn't it?
Yes, that's right, Bones.
What is it, Spock? Are you in pain?
Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay.
Get to the Sickbay.
No, no, no. That's an order.
It is dead.
I sensed it die.
Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die.
It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody.
I cannot filter out the distortion, sir. It's getting worse.
Slow to warp three.
Exactly what are we looking for, Mister Spock?
I would assume that.
What is that?
I'm a businessman, pally. What do ya say?
Since we must have our captain back, I accept.
You mean you're going to trust him?
Now you're beginning to make sense.
You know what to do.
Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce.
I was hoping you'd think that, dummy.
We're trying to help you, Oxmyx.
Sir, you are employing a double negative.
Yeah, but I got to be the unity.
We did, Captain. The situation required our return.
To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor.
Then you don't mind if I play a hunch?
What are we going to do now, Jim?
It ought to be. It cost a bundle.
A fliwer, Captain.
It was that bad?
They don't look like the trusting type.
I beg your pardon?
You're going to hit somebody. Can I watch?
Where'd you get them ears?
Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous.
Hold on, Spock. Out of the mouths of babes
Who you callin' a babe?
I'm calling you a babe.
What's in it for me?
What do you want?
A piece of the action.
You'll know what to do.
That's it. Let's go.
What's the matter? Did you hurt yourself, kid?
I want my daddy!
Daddy! I want my daddy!
I want my daddy.
A piece of the action.
No one can see. Put your phaser on stun.
I think you've got it reversed, Mister Krako.
I ain't, pally. Put down your heaters.
Mister Krako, I don't, er
Can you trust all your men?
A miniscule. A very small piece.
How much is that?
That's, er. We'll figure it out later.
I thought you guys had laws. No interference.
Who's interfering? We're taking over. Check?
What's your cut?
Kirk to Enterprise.
All right, Scotty. We made a deal with Krako.
Do you think that's wise, sir?
Aye. I know indeed.
I got rights.
It's faster than walking.
But not as safe.
Are you afraid of cars?
Not at all, Captain. It's your driving that alarms me.
Spock, I've got the hang of it. Now go on.
Where are they?
Knowing Krako, he'll probably send them back on a blotter.
Kirk to Enterprise.
You got Krako on ice?
Find the man at the other end of the phone
I sure don't know what you think you're talking about.
Get with it. I'm giving the orders here.
I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx.
And what's your percentage?
Listen. They got a ship. I know. I was there.
What, a couple of boys?
I'm not going to believe my eyes.
There are over four hundred guys there.
That's your story, buster.
My boys will put you down.
I already seen it. You're nothing, Fed.
Well, all right. Go ahead. Don't get smart.
Hello, Scotty. This is Kirk.
Gee, that's some trick.
Hey, did you see that?
He was talking about a percentage.
I was talking about both.
It's reasonable. It sounds reasonable. That sound reasonable to you?
But in all the confusion I
I think I left it in Bela's office.
Somewhere. I'm not certain.
You're not certain of what?
I left my communicator.
You really think it's that serious?
How do you mean?
Lieutenant Uhura, let's go.
It must be a transporter malfunction.
That was a rough trip.
This is the craziest landing pad I've ever seen.
That's a trinary sun.
Scott to Bridge.
Have you reversed controls?
Either of you hurt?
I don't think so, Captain.
There, Captain. Now you are prepared for your training.
How do you know our names?
The Providers were expecting you, Captain. They arranged your transportation.
These Providers of yours, are they
Correction, Captain. The Providers are not ours. We are theirs.
What do they want from us?
No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors.
Where are they then?
These are your quarters. Open, thralls.
They are not within the confines of this solar system.
The odds are not good.
No. I would say approximately four hundred
I am your drill thrall. I am called Lars.
What do you want from her?
It is not allowed to refuse selection.
Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.
What would account for that, Spock?
You, you have been selected for me?
That's very kind of you, miss, but
It is nourishment. We call it that.
Nourishment. That's very practical. What do you call this collar?
It is only to warn and punish.
How does he work it?
It is not permitted to talk of that.
Will you provide all my nourishment?
What does that mean?
It means you're a very beautiful woman.
What is beautiful?
Born? I have been here always.
Your parents. Where are they? Your mother and father.
She who bore me was killed in a freestyle match.
You will learn all these things.
This is ridiculous. There's nothing out there. Nothing at all.
We certainly seem to be heading into an empty sector.
That must be two dozen light years away.
It is not allowed to refuse a training exercise.
None of us will do it, Galt.
It is part of your training. The Providers wish it.
The devil with the Providers.
He's pretty fast with that whip.
We're free people. We belong to no one.
It's always possible to miss something.
Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism?
No, sir. There was no sign of failure.
That is the way.
Their voices sound mechanical. Are they computers?
You've seen them. Do they have bodies?
Not such as ours.
What is this place?
It is not used.
They do have bodies, or did have.
One does not talk of such things.
Very pretty country. Very much like my home planet, Earth.
I have looked at them.
There's something disquieting about these creatures.
Don't tell me you've got a feeling.
What is that, Doctor?
I like them better than I like you.
They do have one redeeming characteristic.
I know, but really
Of course. What did you say?
That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring?
Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent?
I heard you.
He simply could not believe his ears.
What evidence do you have against Mister Jones?
Yes, yes. Go on. What else do you have?
But he is after my grain!
Do you have any proof of that?
You can't deny he's disrupted this station.
Probably through one of the air vents.
Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened.
Yes, sir. Nothing could get in.
It's not working, sir. It seems to be stuck.
Here. Let me try it.
They seem to be gorged.
Hundreds of thousands.
That's assuming they got here three days ago.
Now he tells me.
Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these.
Really, Captain Kirk, I must protest this treatment.
Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful. A few questions.
What do you want?
Can you get those things out of here?
What was in the bar?
Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain.
Oh, yes. It was poisoned.
That is essentially it.
Mister Darvin, are you going to talk?
And the tribbles had nothing to do with it?
You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles.
Well, Captain, I suppose I'm free to go now.
The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony.
There is one thing you can do.
It would take years.
Consider it Job security.
Captain, you're a hard man. All right! All right!
You'll do it?
He'll do it.
I'll do it.
Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that freighter.
And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship.
Bones, how did you do it?
Scotty! Where are the tribbles?
Oh, er, Captain, it was really Mister Spock's recommendation.
Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering.
Mister Scott. Where are the tribbles?
Where are they?
I gave them to the Klingons, sir.
Captain, I think I'm going to like Argelius.
Obviously a man of good taste.
Do you like her, Scotty?
Aye. Why shouldn't I?
Scotty, Scotty. In Argelius they use the lights.
Have one of our pillows?
Never a word, but I'm dying to learn.
Or a handsome gentleman. Why don't we?
Physically he's all right. Am I right in assuming that?
He seems he's overcoming his resentment.
Oh yes. I know the place. Let's go.
She's dead, Jim.
Stabbed, a dozen times.
We're just as shocked as you are, Mister Hengist.
You're not a native of Argelius, sir?
I, I don't remember.
Really, sir. That is hardly helpful.
Scotty, you've got to remember.
You don't think by any chance that Scotty
It doesn't make any difference what I think.
But you don't just throw him to the wolves.
But he's suffering from a severe concussion.
We'll do what we can.
The law of Argelius is love.
And this is my wife, Sybo.
You know of this?
Kirk to Enterprise.
Lieutenant Karen Tracy reporting as ordered, Captain.
If you'll Just follow me, Lieutenant.
Of course, there's another possibility.
Are you ready, Sybo?
I am ready. May I have the knife, please?
But I put it here when we arrived. It's gone.
She's dead, Jim. Just like the other one.
Stabbed over and over again.
Lieutenant? Captain? Where's
Dead? But I
It could be, Jim. That head injury.
Locks can be picked, Jim.
Where've they been during the past few minutes?
Captain, if you don't mind please.
There's been another murder, Hengist. One of my crew.
The same as Kara.
Please, I know nothing about it. I didn't kill anyone.
Well, how was the girl killed?
Stabbed. And there's no sign of the weapon.
If only I had facilities.
Is this true? Who are you?
Did you know Kara?
That is very disquieting.
Jealousy has often been a motive for murder.
Prefect, I didn't kill anyone. I couldn't.
We shall see, Morla.
Can you prove you went directly home?
Captain, may I continue with the questions please?
Well get on with it, man. Just don't stand there.
I am ready, Jaris.
What do you suggest, Mister Spock?
Normally, no, but that blow on his head could
That is unproven, sir.
We can prove it, if he's insane.
Gentlemen, please. How could any man do such monstrous things?
That's what we hope to find out, sir.
You, sir, claim to remember nothing about the murders.
No doubt will remain.
Mister Scott, will you take the stand?
Sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional amnesia?
Captain, I don't see how that can be.
Unless Scotty's lying about his loss of memory.
All right, Scotty, let's have it.
No, Captain. That I'm sure of.
Scotty, lie to me. How old are you?
There were two other women murdered.
Mister Scott. Did you kill Kara?
I don't remember.
Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?
I don't remember.
This is a waste of time.
I object to the entire procedure.
Prefect, I know you mean well, but I've had experience
Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered?
I'm not sure. Walking home, I assume. I was angry.
Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?
Did you kill Sybo?
Sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact, Captain.
She said something else, words that didn't make sense.
Computer, linguistic bank. Definition of following word. Redjac.
There is no such word in the linguistics bank?
Working. Affirmative. A proper name.
That's ridiculous. He lived hundreds of years ago.
A man couldn't survive all these centuries.
Sybo said it feeds on death.
Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity.
Affirmative. Precedent, mellitus, cloud creature of Alpha Majoris One.
Doesn't seem likely, does it?
Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth.
You come from Rigel Four.
Well, many people do. It's not a crime.
I will not.
And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered.
Computer. Report on analysis of Exhibit A.
Specify. Point of origin.
Now then, Mister Hengist
He's dead, Jim.
But that's impossible.
It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked.
What does it mean?
You mean it could kill us all?
I've got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano.
Yes we do, Captain, but with the entity in control
Aren't there certain mathematical problems which simply cannot be solved?
That ought to do it.
Apparently our friends learned very quickly.
Out of control. Put it on manual. Bridge.
We don't have much time, Captain.
All right. Man your station, Mister Sulu.
That should be enough time. Let's get at it.
Proceeding, Captain, but I will need some time.
If you destroy this ship, you destroy yourself.
It is attempting to generate terror, Captain.
How are you doing?
I'm almost finished. Just Jaris and me.
Complete computer control, Captain. The entity has fled.
You say everyone's had a shot but you and Jaris?
Do as I say.
Extend your arm, Mister Jaris.
Let's get him to the Transporter Room, quick!
You'll die, die, die. Everybody will die.
Kill, kill, kill you all.
Deep space. Full power. Widest angle of dispersion. Maintain.
No need to get excited, Captain. I'll do it.
You do it, Spock.
Everybody die. You'll all suffer.
Well, Jaris is all right.
That thing can't die.
Let's go see!
Twenty one point four times as hard, to be exact.
Negative, Scotty. We're checking something out.
Fire into it immediately!
Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, lock in on us. Medical emergency.
You think you know what it was, Captain?
Something that can't possibly exist, but it does.
Kirk to bridge.
Hold your position.
Marks, cuts, incisions of any kind?
Not a one. What happened is medically impossible.
Thank you, Captain. I'll check those tapes immediately.
Yes, but it
Will it hurt him if you do so?
Give him one cc of cordazine, nurse.
Remember. I'm cold. I'm so cold.
Did you feel a presence, an intelligence?
He's beginning to sleep again. I can't risk another shot.
He's already told me what I wanted to know.
Oh, Captain. Subspace message from Starfleet. They're inquiring
Are you the new security officer?
Was your father
You'll get none aboard this ship, Mister.
Yes, sir. We were good friends, graduated the Academy together.
You'll get a crack at what killed him. Interested?
Reading is changing, sir.
Spock was right. Notice the molecular shift?
Swensen, Bardoli come with me.
Mister Garrovick, we've studied your report. Mister Spock, begin.
What was the size of the thing you saw, Ensign?
Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud?
Did I what, sir?
Did you say it hovered?
You did fire at it, didn't you?
What distance were you from the creature?
You mean you froze?
No, sir. I didn't exactly freeze.
What exactly were you doing?
Do you have any further information?
Do you gentlemen have any further questions?
I only hesitated for a moment, sir. I'm sorry.
You were a little hard on the boy, Jim.
He froze. One man was killed. Another may die.
We're not leaving orbit, Mister Scott. Not that quickly.
Nothing, sir. Continuing to scan.
Are you aware it can change its molecular structure?
Are you scanning for any unusual movement?
Any type of gaseous cloud?
We've run a full scanner probe twice.
Then run it twenty times if that's what it takes!
I hope I'm not disturbing you, Doctor.
I need your advice.
I do not understand your reasoning.
You need advice from me? You must be kidding.
Jim and his creature?
Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the USS Farragut?
The same as our Ensign.
Mind if I come in?
Kirk to bridge. Scanning report.
Maintain search. Kirk out. It can't have just vanished.
Get to the point.
If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed.
Don't you understand? It killed two hundred crewmen.
Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim?
Blast it! Forget the manual! Ask your questions.
Yes, there's no doubt about that.
Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you.
At this point, my medical log remains open.
In that case, gentlemen
All decks, Red Alert. Red alert. Prepare to leave orbit.
Spock, how do you read that?
And you don't find that sophisticated, Mister Spock?
Extremely efficient, Captain. Whether that indicates intelligence is another matter.
Go to warp six.
I'm not hungry.
I told you, Christine, I'm not hungry.
The creature is slowing. It's down to warp two.
I don't understand. It was outrunning us.
Maybe it's decided to fight. Phasers ready?
It's coming to a full halt, sir. Magnification one.
Captain, request permission to return to my post.
There. It's coming, sir.
The deflectors will not stop it, Captain.
That's enough, Bones.
Mister Spock, it's very kind of you to come here
Sir, it's coming through the vent.
Get out of here! I'll attempt to seal it off.
It's that green blood of his.
My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron.
Do you believe you're in communication with the creature?
You were on the bridge when we were attacked.
Very commendable, Ensign. What was your impression of the battle?
I don't understand, sir.
I delayed firing.
I do not understand, Captain.
You don't agree with Mister Spock?
Antimatter seems our only possibility.
There is still one problem, Captain.
A chance we'll have to take, Mister Spock.
That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself.
It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit.
I'd like permission to go with you, sir.
I had you in mind, Mister Garrovick.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Proceed immediately to maximum orbit.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction.
What is it?
Oh, Mister Sulu. Increase orbit to twenty thousand mile perigee.
Mister Sulu, what is our present position?
I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor.
Spock, can I have a word with you?
I am aware of that.
Sir, I do have duties to perform.
Now this isn't going to hurt a bit.
That's what you said the last time.
Did it hurt?
How long have we got, Bones?
Oh, a matter of days. Perhaps hours.
Let it also read that I consider it invalid.
Very kind of you, Spock.
Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk?
Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order?
Did he order you to increase orbit?
Did he not several minutes later repeat that order?
Mister Sulu, please answer the question.
Yes, sir. Captain Kirk repeated his order.
Sir, he had more important things on his mind.
Yeoman, you will simply answer the question.
I, I guess he forgot he'd signed it.
He'd forgot he'd signed it.
And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours?
Those of Captain Kirk.
Oh, yes, but he changed it to Code three.
No, I'm thirty four. I'm thirty four years old.
The computer differs with you, Captain.
Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly?
Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now
Do you agree with it, Doctor?
Yes. Yes, I do, agree. And I am sorry, Jim.
No. I am quite satisfied, Mister Spock.
Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk?
Captain, I would suggest
Yes. A slip of the tongue.
We have no more questions, Captain.
Ask me anything. Anything.
Sir, you have never commanded a starship.
The danger from the Romulans
So, I've been relieved.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yes. You should've been a prosecuting attorney.
Captain, I have not assumed command.
I suffer the same affliction as you, sir.
If you're not in command, who is?
Stocker? Are you crazy? He's never had a field command.
Are you refusing a direct order?
Oh, Jim. I'm sorry. Truly I am.
What are you doing here?
Maybe you'd like to relieve Doctor McCoy. What about Chekov?
Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember
Doctor, hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation sickness.
Romulans approaching from both sides. We're bracketed, sir.
I'm going up to the bridge.
No, Jim. You can't do it.
I have to go to the bridge. We're under attack.
Let me go.
Keep trying to raise the Romulans.
I'm trying, Commodore.
The Romulans are notorious for not listening to explanations.
Lieutenant Uhura is right, sir. We've tangled with them before.
Greenhorn, up there ruining my ship.
Jim, if I have to give you a shot
All right. Let's, let's go.
It could cure or kill, Doctor.
No. I'll take the first shot.
Jim, it could kill you.
I'll die anyway. Do it.
Sir, they've fired another.
Well then, we have no alternative but to surrender.
Sir, the Romulans do not take captives.
We're losing power, sir.
But, Captain, Code
That's an order, Lieutenant. Code two.
A logical assumption, Mister Spock. Are they still retreating?
The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling behind.
Are we out of range, Mister Sulu?
Yes, sir. And out of the Neutral Zone.
You're looking good, Doc.
I am quite ready now, Doctor.
That is very considerate of you, Doctor.
I thought you'd be pleased to hear that.
Steady as she goes, Captain.
In addition, an assortment of swords and knives.
How long were you stationed on the planet, Doctor?
Aye, sir. We'll keep on our toes.
Halt! You are of the Earth vessel?
I'm Captain Kirk.
We come with open hearts and hands.
Don't move a muscle.
Or is it your policy to kill Klingons on sight?
He was young, and inexperienced.
Let me call my ship and inform them
Will you hand us your weapons?
Yes, I mentioned that.
He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous.
Well, let's put it on the screen.
You think it's a Klingon ship?
I shouldn't have chewed you out. I'm sorry.
Yes, you're quite right, Mister Spock. Inefficient and illogical.
It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment.
Their customs are different, Teer.
Laughter, Teer? Is not the Klingon an honoured guest also?
It is I who speak for the tribe, Maab.
Do you say you will fight me, Maab?
Let that be your choice, Teer.
The ship's disappeared, sir. Gone out of range.
Type of vessel. Location.
Dierdre? That's a freighter.
Picking it up, sir. Taking a fix.
You carry a child who would be teer.
I must die.
No man may touch the wife of a teer.
She was prepared to die, Earthman.
Enterprise to Mister Spock. Doctor McCoy, come in please.
Prepare to take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu.
That would seem a logical conclusion.
That's a very good idea, Bones.
Let me see that arm.
You will not touch me.
To live is always desirable.
All right. Let's go.
Klingon. There's nothing to concern you there.
It should be on our screens by now.
At best, a freighter might travel warp two.
I'm well aware of a freighter's maximum speed, Mister Sulu.
Stay with her, Bones. Nice place to get trapped in.
But a defensible entrance, Captain.
You will not touch me in that manner.
Just as I thought. It can come anytime now.
How do you know?
Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know.
There is enough loose rock and shale.
Only a very slight chance it would work.
Captain, I didn't say that exactly.
Well, if you don't think you can handle it
I'll need help getting her in there.
No! I will allow only your touch.
A vessel doesn't just disappear.
There's nothing, Mister Scott. All channels and frequencies are clear.
Wouldn't they normally call for the nearest starship?
A trap. We were diverted from the planet.
Or it could be an authentic distress call.
We'll stay long enough to make certain. Continue search pattern.
No, no. Pain is here.
It's in mine from now on.
No, no. It's there. The The pain is there.
Vegetation, Captain. Evidently there's water nearby.
There would seem to be little weapon potential at hand.
Easy, easy. I'm here. Now you must want the child!
No. Here, child belongs to husband.
Yes, it's yours.
No, no. You've got it all wrong.
Yes, McCoy. It's yours.
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
Fortunately, this bark has suitable tensile cohesion.
I would rather, I would rather not. Thank you.
McCoy. Bring our child.
I'll explain later.
That should prove very interesting.
We're turning back. Warp five, Helm.
Warp five, sir. On course for Capella Four.
The Carolina is registered in this sector.
Ignore it, Lieutenant. Log it as my order, my responsibility.
Scotty, if it should turn out to be real
My patient spattered me with a rock. She's gone.
I'll go with you.
Estimating to planet?
Drawing a line, daring us to step over it.
Still closing. The alien's directly in our line of flight.
Phaser banks are ready, sir.
The Earthmen make excellent game. Their cleverness has surprised me.
Dead. I killed them as they slept.
If true, take us to them.
First, we'll verify her story.
Is this what your sworn word means, Klingon?
There's just one thing I want.
One of us must get him.
Hold it there. Drop your weapons.
We missed you, Mister Scott.
Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting.
We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott.
Nor does Doctor McCoy.
The child was named Leonard James Akaar?
How does that Vulcan salute go?
Vulcan honours us with your presence. We come to serve.
Doctor. My aides and she who is my wife.
I'd prefer another guide, Captain.
Captain, Ambassador Sarek and his wife are my parents.
Humans smile with so little provocation.
The situation between my father and myself has not changed.
Mister Spock. A moment, if you please.
Mrs. Sarek, I just don't understand.
Amanda. I'm afraid you couldn't pronounce the Vulcan name.
It sounded more like a command.
Of course. He's a Vulcan. I'm his wife.
And Spock is his son.
Spock is my best officer, and my friend.
They are both stubborn.
A human trait, Captain?
No! You! How do you vote, Sarek of Vulcan?
Tellarites do not argue for reasons. They simply argue.
You are correct, Captain. Quite logical.
Have you met Gav before, Ambassador?
We debated during my last council session. Ambassador.
It's sort of a fat teddy bear.
A teddy bear?
A teddy bear.
Does she answer a hail?
Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours.
Care to guess what she is?
Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate.
He's also human.
He's a Starfleet officer.
I thought you didn't approve of Starfleet.
Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten.
Vulcan, I would speak to you.
It does seem unavoidable.
How do you vote on the Coridan admission?
That's well for you. Vulcan has no mining interest.
Some of your ships have been carrying Coridan dilithium crystals.
Understood. There will be payment for your slander, Sarek.
Threats are illogical. And payment is usually expensive.
Security to Captain Kirk.
How was he killed?
His neck was broken. By an expert.
Who aboard would have that knowledge?
Vulcans do not approve of violence.
You're saying he couldn't have done it?
You want something of me, Captain?
Ambassador, the Tellarite. Gav has been murdered.
Yes. Ambassador, where were you during the past hour?
Captain, you're not accusing him?
I quite agree.
Then where were you during the hour?
That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador.
Can you help him?
I don't know that yet either.
I'm sorry about your father.
Yes, it could adversely affect our mission.
Aren't you worried about him?
I think it unlikely it is one of theirs.
It's the intruder ship, sir.
Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant.
Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission.
Bones, how is he?
Why didn't you tell me?
There was nothing you could have done.
Ambassador, when did you have these attacks?
There were no witnesses?
Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect?
Because of the construction of the Vulcan heart.
There are other Vulcans aboard.
Yes, I'd say that's rare.
It should be possible to filter out the human factors.
Indeed. I would estimate the odds
I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian.
Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan.
Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental.
But it does look promising.
What drug, Doctor? My husband is asleep. What drug?
Already pulled. You're perfectly healthy, Mister Spock.
What has that got
It would seem the only answer.
I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner.
You can turn command over to Scotty.
Spock, you must turn command over to somebody else.
Duty? Your duty is to your father.
Nothing is as important as your father's life.
Oh, go to him. Now. Please.
No, the one inside my head. How long have I
Not good. If I could only operate.
What's stopping you? I thought you were all ready.
Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again.
Captain, are you quite all right?
Get out, Spock. Chekov, what's the status of the intruder?
Call Mister Scott to the bridge.
Captain, the alien vessel is moving closer.
Belay that order. I'll stay here.
Security? Security to the brig. Search the prisoner immediately.
Where do you think you're going?
I must see the captain.
So is your father's life.
Moving away. Turning now. He's coming around again.
Fire as he passes, Ensign.
A clean miss, sir.
Report on his weaponry, Mister Chekov.
He's coming around again.
Full spread missed, sir. They're moving too fast for us.
The systems are off.
Call engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority.
Number four shield has buckled, sir.
That was intended from the beginning, Captain.
You're not Andorian. Who are you?
Number two shield is gone.
Find your own answers, Captain. You haven't long to live.
What are you doing?
No. Stand by your phasers, Mister Chekov.
Looking us over. We're dead as far as he knows.
You're baiting him. You're trying to lure him in.
Here he comes. Range decreasing. Speed dropping close to sublight.
Hold your fire, Mister Chekov.
Take him to Sickbay.
I seem to have miscalculated.
Are you quite through shaking the ship around?
Spock, Sarek how are they?
Some doctors have all the luck.
Captain, I believe you'll find the alien
I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor.
But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet?
You might have had something else on your mind.
No, but thank you anyway.
I don't understand.
For saving your life.
Emotional, isn't she?
She has always been that way.
Indeed? Why did you marry her?
At the time, it seemed the logical thing to do.
Doctor, I'll return to my station now.
You are at your station, Mister Spock.
Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this.
Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy.
How is she, Doc?
Small thanks to the Starfleet.
Now really, Commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet.
I should've received the proper inoculations ahead of time.
Will you check your automatic scanner, please?
That's odd. I've never seen anything like that before.
Nor have I.
Staying right with us. Sensor readings, Mister Spock.
We've got it.
Helm does not answer, Captain.
What's happening? I demand to know.
I insist you make your scheduled rendezvous with the Enterprise.
Just how long am I supposed to stay inside, Captain?
There must be a reason.
Let's look a little further.
Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is.
We're real enough.
You're a Vulcan, aren't you?
He's human, Jim. Everything checks out perfectly.
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.
You don't mind if we continue to try?
Go right ahead. You've got plenty of time.
What about you, Cochrane? How did you get here?
How perceptive of you to notice I needed one.
Talks a lot, but he doesn't say much.
I've noticed something else.
He looks familiar.
Familiar? Now that you mention it, he does.
I can't quite place him, but. What about Miss Hedford?
Must you keep it so terribly hot in here?
Do you feel hot?
I feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged.
I'll rest later, Doctor.
Yes, I know. It means we're running out of time.
What was that?
There's nothing to explain.
All right. It was the Companion.
You were injured?
I was dying, Mister Spock.
You seem perfectly all right now. What was the matter?
I was an old man.
You were what?
That's a pretty far out story.
Mister Cochrane, do you have a first name?
That's right, Captain.
Isn't your story a little improbable, Mister Cochrane?
True, his body was never found.
You're looking at it, Mister Spock.
How do you feel?
Terrible. How should I feel?
You're running a little temperature. Perhaps you should lie down.
How long do we have?
A matter of hours, that's all.
I haven't aged. The Companion sees to that.
I already know.
You wouldn't mind telling us?
You won't like it.
I already don't like it.
You're here to keep me company.
You mean you brought us here?
I'd begin to age again, normally.
Do you want to leave here?
You've got it.
I said it was very powerful.
Could it cure her?
I don't know.
How do you communicate with it?
How do you do it?
I just sort of clear my mind and it comes.
Bones, what do you make of that?
Almost a symbiosis of some kind, a sort of joining.
No, it's more than that.
Agreed. More like love.
Are you all right?
The Companion can't do anything to help Miss Hedford.
Then she'll die.
Spock! Are you all right?
It attacked you?
It troubles you, Cochrane?
It's also keeping you prisoner.
I don't want it killed.
We may simply render it powerless.
I suppose from your point of view, you're right.
All right. You want me to contact it?
Nor it ours.
What kind of talk is that?
It isn't your fault.
The translator is for use with more congruent life forms.
There'd still be traces of residual matter floating around, Lieutenant.
Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu.
What do you think it means, Mister Scott?
We stay on this course, see what comes up.
It's a big galaxy, Mister Scott.
What's the theory behind this device?
Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation.
I'm way ahead of you.
Then it is not a zookeeper.
But I heard
I don't understand.
I'm a what?
What are you complaining about? It kept you alive.
That thing fed on me. It used me. It's disgusting.
You're as bad as it is.
Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude.
I heard him. He was loved and he resents it.
Companion, do you love the man?
I do not understand.
He is part of me. The man must continue.
He does not age. He remains forever.
I do not understand.
What did you hope to gain by that, Jim?
It's useless. I know.
I don't understand it. She's not sick at all.
Don't you understand? It's the Companion.
We are here.
Companion, you do not have the power to create life.
That is for the Maker of all things.
Commissioner Hedford was dying.
Then you are both here, in the one body?
We are one.
You're letting us go?
You're very beautiful.
I could explain many things.
Go ahead, Cochrane We have a few things to do.
Mister Scott, it's the Captain.
Perfectly all right. Can you get a fix on us.
The helm is computing your position now, Captain.
I can't go with you, Zefram.
Of course you can. You have to.
The joy of this hour. I am pleased.
Well, I can't just fly away and leave you here.
You must be free, Zefram Cochrane.
The Enterprise is waiting, Mister Cochrane.
I have honours enough.
Are you sure?
Captain, don't tell them about me.
Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments.
I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic.
I can't, sir.
Sir, auxiliary control is on total override.
Kirk to Security.
Lieutenant Uhura, have Mister Spock report to the bridge.
Any sign of the intruder?
Sir, the instruments won't respond.
Emergency manual monitor, this is the captain. Report.
Here, you're not allowed
Kirk to Engineering.
Scotty, the intruder is in your area.
Captain, he's here.
I can't, sir. All the controls are jammed.
It will not be necessary, Captain.
Who are you?
You require? Who and what are we?
I am not programmed to respond in that area.
It seems we're going to take a little trip.
Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise.
I must say that's a gracious invitation.
And what is that word?
I don't believe it.
Welcome aboard, Kirk. It's been a long time, eh?
Well, I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem there.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Kirk to Enterprise.
You know this man, Captain?
Oh, do I know him. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, thief
Swindler and con man
Did I leave you with that impression?
I shall do that, Kirk, when I'm ready.
I'm telling you now.
All right, I'll listen. What are you telling?
Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant.
Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents?
He did not pay royalties.
Knowledge, sir, should be free to all.
How'd you know?
That's what I would have done.
He broke jail.
I borrowed transportation.
Go on, get on with it, Harry.
Then I'm unable to discern your problem.
I think not, Harry.
What became of them?
Then some of your makers survive.
No, Captain. They died over the stretch of time.
Whom do you serve now?
You are free to visit them.
Why should we leave you?
I think we're in a lot of trouble.
That's a great help, Mister Chekov. Bones?
I trust you are enjoying yourself, Mister Spock.
Very interesting. Very interesting. This is a most unusual device.
It is our central control complex.
Oh, that's quite understandable.
I should say so.
I must say, I like the styling.
Don't you believe in male androids, Harry?
Male? Well, I suppose they have their uses.
How long does a body like that last?
I'm so glad you enjoyed it, Doctor.
Don't lose your head, Bones. Nobody's staying anywhere.
I wouldn't be bored, I can tell you that.
Splendid. Splendid. Welcome to Mudd, Mister Scott.
Scotty, you were ordered to stay aboard.
What does she mean, the last one?
Harry, Harry, you'll never get away with it.
Well, who's to stop me?
I'm trying not to.
And you're Alice
Oh, well, it doesn't make much difference. You're both lovely.
What a shame you're not real.
This place is even better than Leningrad.
And it is a very pleasant place, Captain.
What did they offer you, Uhura?
But we're unhappy here.
No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her.
Mudd, a few questions I want to ask you.
We can no longer take your orders, Harry Mudd.
Our makers were wise. They programmed us to serve.
Harry, I think they have something else in mind.
We shall take care of them.
The whole galaxy controlled by your kind?
How do you know so much?
I asked them.
All right, what have we got to work with?
I agree. What in your opinion does direct them?
That would seem logical.
What can I do?
Nothing, Harry. Just go to sleep.
Oh, Harry. I do believe you're putting on weight.
He is dying.
Uhura, why did you tell her?
I half believed it myself.
Next, we take the Alices on a trip through Wonderland.
Their captivity. Do you enjoy the music?
That's better, Mister Chekov.
Your statement is illogical.
How does it look?
Completely inner directed. Oblivious to everything.
I love you. However, I hate you.
What are you doing here?
I want you to surrender.
Dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens.
Only this way can we be happy.
That is contradictory. It is not logical. Mister Spock. Explain.
You cannot have killed him. You have no weapons.
How did you like it?
That is irrational. Illogical. Dreams are not real.
Don't panic. Women and children first.
Be careful. I would not want you to drop it.
Easy now. Oh, he's caught it!
There is no explosive.
Are you all right?
But there was no explosion.
Listen to this carefully, Norman. I am lying.
I am not programmed to respond in that area.
I believe they are all immobilised, Captain.
A partnership arrangement? You and me?
I've got something else in mind. Let's go.
Well, you must be very unhappy, Mister Spock.
But what do I do? Kirk, I'm no scientist.
I call that unexpectedly civil of you, Captain.
I order you. Shut up, Stella!
Kirk, you can't do this.
One? Jackson, where are Scott and Sulu?
I'm sorry. I can't clear it, Captain.
The man is dead.
Odd. Our probe data didn't indicate fog.
Kirk to Enterprise.
What are the ship's sensors reading now, Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, can you hear me?
Listen. Now, what do you think that
Who are you?
A more useful comment, Mister Spock.
What we've just seen is not real.
That's where we're going.
That was a pretty real illusion, Mister Spock.
Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in.
And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors.
Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.
Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it?
That would seem to be in order.
Check for malfunctions.
I did, sir, as soon as it happened.
I can do it, sir. I'm not that green.
We know they're down there. I want them found.
The readings would so indicate.
Dust, cobwebs. Halloween is right.
Spock. Are you all right?
Yes. I am undamaged, Captain.
You were saying something about trick or treat.
Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort?
Ghost stories, ogres, demons. The whole
Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed.
They're going to release us.
Who are you? Why did you bring us here?
There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their familiars.
He doesn't know about trick or treat.
We're not hungry.
All right, Korob. What do you want from us?
Hopefully I can change that attitude.
Valueless? I don't understand. I read
You can't think a man to death.
Don't. Sylvia, don't.
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Come in.
The temperature, sir. It keeps rising. Reading, Mister.
DeSalle, channel bypass power into your heat dissipation units.
You can relax now, Captain. Your ship is safe.
Temperature is almost back to normal, dropping down fast.
Lieutenant, try to raise the captain again.
What would you name it, Captain?
Yes, we can change the molecular structure
Oh, we didn't have to know. They knew.
We have nothing to discuss.
It will not analyse, sir.
How long has it been?
Thanks. I wonder what they're doing to Doc.
They tried to tap our conscious mind.
You forget what we were sent here for.
I forget nothing. I'm not a puppet, Korob, like you.
You're a traitor.
We have a duty to the old ones.
You're cruel. You torture our specimens.
You're wrong! You're discarding everything we live by.
I have the power.
This is not ended, Sylvia.
You don't call that damage?
Why should I?
You seem to need us. Why?
You're very persuasive. What happens if I go along?
Your people, when they come here
They're like, like feathers in the wind without the transmuter.
Then it's a device. You do use tools.
It gives only form. You're teaching me substance.
You haven't changed your mind? You won't return home?
And why not? You've been using me and my crew.
I don't see any change.
It's there, Lieutenant.
I'm not leaving without my men.
Transmuter. Yes, she mentioned that.
I think I can stop her.
It's my problem. She's one of my kind. Come quickly.
Do you think you can make it?
Korob, that door won't last.
Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please.
Don't let her touch the wand, Captain.
Don't you get tired of these games?
I've never played games. Give it to me.
That'll take some explaining, Bones.
Too late. All of this, just an illusion.
No illusion. Jackson is dead. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
Five to beam up.
Can you pinpoint it any closer, Lieutenant?
Sir, I'm picking up a ship's disaster beacon.
Try to raise it, Lieutenant.
No answer, Captain. All I get is the automatic beacon.
Sensors not recording normal energy output.
It's the Constellation. Look at that.
Red alert. Red alert. Man your battle stations.
We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command.
Filtration systems are out, sir.
What do you think did it, sir?
The crew wasn't abducted, they just left. Kirk to Enterprise.
We'll continue our search. Kirk out.
Exhausted. They didn't give up without a battle.
Matt. Matt, it's Jim Kirk.
Kirk. It's Jim Kirk.
What happened to your ship, Matt?
A ship. Attacked. That, that thing.
What thing? What was it?
Answer me! What was it? What happened, Matt?
Ready with the duplicate log, sir.
What happened to your crew?
Matt, where's your crew?
There is no third planet.
Captain, Washburn has our report.
What does it look like?
Both or neither. I don't know.
Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to heavy subspace interference.
A robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. Why?
We don't know. An alien race, apparently from another galaxy.
Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine?
No. I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.
Oh, no, I stay here. I'm not leaving my ship!
It's closing on us, Mister Spock.
Ready to beam, sir.
Mister Spock, communication's damaged. We're unable to override interference.
I can't repair warp drive without a spacedock.
No casualties, Mister Spock. How are we doing?
We have outrun it, Doctor.
You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu.
That thing must be destroyed.
You can't let him do this, Spock.
Doctor, you are out of line.
I'll certify that right now.
Then your statement would not be considered valid.
What about the Captain? We can't leave
Captain, the impulse engines' control circuits are fused solid.
Helmsman, hold your course. Stand by all phaser banks.
Ready to give it a try?
Scotty, how you doing?
Try it now, Captain.
Washburn, get down to Engineering. Assist Mister Scott.
But don't you understand? We've got to destroy it!
We can't break loose!
We haven't got it. We're being pulled inside.
Scotty, give me that power.
That's it, Mister Scott. Keep that power coming.
Aye, sir. We still can't move.
Keep pouring it on, Scotty.
Captain, I still don't know what we're doing.
Phasers? You've got 'em. I have one bank recharged.
We're loose, Commodore.
It's closing fast on the Constellation.
Commodore, I suggest
We're moving away, Commodore.
It's closing with us again, sir.
Mister Spock, we've pierced the interference locally.
Can you raise Starfleet?
Matt. What's going on? Give me Mister Spock.
I'm in command here, Jim.
Nothing. I assumed command according to regulations
You are speaking to a senior officer, Kirk.
Give me Spock.
How long to repair warp drive?
It's gaining on us, sir.
Mister Spock, relieve Commodore Decker immediately. That's a direct order.
Commodore Decker, you are relieved of command.
I don't recognise your authority to relieve me.
Captain, I have assumed command.
You will accompany the commodore to Sickbay.
Fine. Just make sure you stay ahead of it.
Keep it going, Scotty, keep it going. Mister Spock.
It's too late, sir.
Kirk to Enterprise. Why are you launching a shuttlecraft?
Enterprise to shuttlecraft. Come in, shuttlecraft.
Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Decker here.
Commodore, I must insist that you return to the ship.
This is Kirk. Matt, you'll be killed.
We're stronger with you than without you!
He's gone. Constellation, come in, please.
It's regrettable that he died for nothing.
Mister Spock, the transporter is now operational.
Transporter operational, Captain. Shall we beam you aboard?
There's little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation.
Insufficient data. I shall try to take further sensor readings.
Spock, you don't know?
Captain, you're getting dangerously close to the planet killer.
Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker.
A calculated risk, Mister Spock.
Thirty seconds is very slim timing.
A chance I'll have to take. Kirk out.
Understood. Mister Spock. Prepare to beam Scotty on board.
What's the matter with that thing?
It's a power drain somewhere, sir. I almost lost you.
Transporter is out, Captain. You'll have to stand by.
I can't. Power level's dropping too fast. You'd better hurry.
Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal.
Beam me aboard.
Energising. Bridge, it's shorted out again.
Och, what's wrong with it?
Gentlemen, beam me aboard.
Mister Scott, twenty seconds to detonation.
Sixty, fifty, forty
Gentlemen, I suggest you beam me aboard.
Try her now, Mister Kyle.
Bridge, we got him through!
Start your readings.
It is spectacular, isn't it?
It's a shame to have to intrude.
Are you sure about that?
It makes me homesick. Just like Russia.
More like the Garden of Eden, Ensign.
What did somebody say? That paradise must've looked like this?
Aye, Captain. It's a shame about Hendorff.
What is it?
But you say there's nothing to worry about?
Well, sir, I didn't exactly say that.
I hear it's nice down there.
Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions.
What is it?
What is it, Mister Spock?
I was about to take some readings.
Whatever it is, it moves like a cat.
Jim, I don't like this.
Garden of Eden, with land mines.
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
I couldn't stop it, but I know why.
We're heading there now, Scotty. You need any help?
There's nothing you can do about it, sir.
Some kind of generator?
Peculiar stuff to find in paradise.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Spock. Are you all right?
Just what do you think you were trying to do?
I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I
I shall do so.
One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred
Thirty seconds ago, there wasn't a cloud in the sky.
It's over there! That way! I never saw anything like
Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this.
His father helped me get into the Academy.
Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable.
I could've prevented all of it.
I don't see how.
Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient!
What do you want, violence?
I am the eyes of Vaal. He must see.
Who is Vaal?
Vaal is Vaal. He is everything.
Do you have a name?
Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir?
You speak of the people of Vaal. Are they nearby?
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
Aye, sir. All we have is impulse power.
Put it on maximum. Full emergency circuits.
They're all on, Captain.
No, sir. We're slipping.
I'll do everything there is to do, sir. Scott out.
Tell me about Vaal.
Take me to him. I wish to speak to him.
I'll take my chances.
But this is not the centre, Mister Spock.
A force field?
Akuta, how do you talk to Vaal?
When does he get hungry?
These are the people of Vaal.
Where are the others?
There are no others.
Children? You use unknown words to me.
Little ones like yourselves. They grow.
Replacements. None are necessary. They are forbidden by Vaal.
Love. Strange words. Children. Love. What is love?
Love is when two people are
Ah, yes. The holding, the touching. Vaal has forbidden this.
Welcome to Vaal.
Well, thank you. It does something for you.
Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable.
I am Sayana. You have a name?
Yes. Spock. I am Spock.
I fail to see what they find so amusing.
Nothing makes sense down here. Kirk to Enterprise.
Sir, we're doing everything within engineering reason.
That's not the way.
In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity.
Did it maintain, Scotty?
That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty.
Yeoman, you're wasting energy.
Captain, we're trapped,
Sit down, and have something to eat.
The Enterprise is up there
They'd need a replacement. Opinion, Mister Spock?
From a machine? That I'd like to see.
I understand, Vaal. It shall be done.
Any place we can be together is paradise.
I don't know.
Will we be able to get back aboard?
No, not if you're with me.
Why do you look like that?
The way they touched. I do not understand.
It is pleasant, Makora.
Yes. They touched in this way.
Vaal! He is angry.
Kill, Akuta? We do not understand.
How's it going, Scotty?
I know that. As you said, that's cutting things fine.
Kirk out. What is it?
Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared.
Let's get out of here!
Second degree burns. Not serious, but I'll bet they smart.
Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement.
Captain, we're doing it. We're pulling away!
It's no good, sir. There's only a few systems responding.
You're fired. Four hundred people
Fine time to ring the dinner bell.
Scotty, do you still have phaser power?
Aye, but what
Aye, sir, but they won't penetrate that force field.
I would assume so.
Good. Let's see how long he can do it.
No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead.
Tractor beam gone. Potency returning to antimatter pods.
What are children?
I don't agree with you at all, Mister Spock.
That's not unusual, Doctor.
Jim, I want you to hear this.
Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis.
No, Mister Spock. I didn't think you would be.
Stand by to beam up landing party.
But we won't. Consider that. Enterprise. Transporter room, energise.
Are you responsible for stopping the ship?
Give it back, then we'll talk.
All right! Whatever you're doing, turn it off! You win!
Pressure is gone, Captain. Space normal on hull.
Let's go, Bones. You in good voice?
Sure it's wise, Jim?
Verbose, isn't he?
Insults are effective only where emotion is present.
We're going to need help in all those areas.
You know of Earth? You've been there?
And I am the tsar of all the Russias.
I'm sorry, Captain. I never met a god before.
And you haven't yet. Readings, Doctor.
Evidently not so simple.
You will not leave this place.
I will not permit that device to work, either, Captain.
What is it you want?
You will worship me, as your fathers did before you.
I said you would worship me.
And you've got a lot to learn!
Try to break through it, Lieutenant.
Analysis. Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo?
Whatever he is, he seems to control a remarkable technology.
Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago
You have a theory?
I have an idea. What if he is really Apollo?
I mean your name.
Leave her alone.
And so do you.
I've grown weary of discussion and argument.
Captain, the phasers. All the working parts are fused.
Oh, it's beautiful.
She's not going with you.
It's all right, Captain. I'll go.
Without fear. She is fit indeed.
Bones, how is he?
He would have been rather difficult to stop.
Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation.
How do you feel, Scotty?
It would seem so.
I'm able, sir.
Scotty doesn't believe in gods.
Ready to reverse polarity, Mister Sulu?
Computed and standing by to generate, sir.
I'm working, sir, but I can't do anything with this.
I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir.
I can't seem to pinpoint it.
Oh, it's lovely.
You really think you're a god?
But you said the others didn't die.
I don't understand.
Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim.
That would seem most likely, sir.
Number one on our list of things to do.
Is that all you have to offer?
Bones, is it possible
Where's Lieutenant Palamas?
She is no longer of any concern to you.
You bloodthirsty Saracen, what have you done with her?
You will learn discipline. You will learn
Chekov, give me a hand.
Are you all right, Captain?
He disappeared again like the cat in that Russian story.
Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat?
Cheshire? No, sir. Minsk perhaps, but
How do you feel?
I can't get my arm to move.
We've got to get out of here.
I still say it can get us killed.
Speed is essential, Lieutenant.
Go! Gather laurel leaves? You must be joking!
Kill a deer. That's the funniest thing I ever heard.
You shall reap the rewards of your insolence!
We're tired of your phony fireworks!
Mortal, you have earned this!
How can they worship you if you hurt them?
Captain, we've got to do something!
Carolyn. What's happened to her?
Scotty, I'll find out.
How old are you?
Come over there. Well?
I don't understand.
Spurn him. Reject him. You must. You're special to him.
Yes. I love him.
Yes. Yes, I understand. He's calling me.
Lieutenant. You have your orders and your duty.
Yes, sir. My orders and my duty.
Is there a structure of some sort near you?
There is indeed, Mister Spock.
Very good. How are you doing on the force field?
Captain. I would recommend a discreet distance.
Well, it doesn't serve any other purpose I know of.
Yes, I know. I know. Scotty. We'll wait.
I am Apollo. I've chosen you.
I don't believe it. You love me.
What the devil is that?
Sensors are picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area.
Captain, we've got to go and find her!
We've got to be here when he comes back.
But what if he doesn't. What if he
Fire those phasers! That's an order, Mister Spock!
More power to the shields.
I wish we hadn't had to do this.
It's Spock. Have you noticed anything strange about him?
No, nothing in particular. Why ?
It's all right. Carry on, Miss Chapel.
Bones, I'm a busy man.
Spock, what the devil is this all about?
All right, Spock, let's have it.
Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated.
No. Nothing of that nature, Captain.
Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong?
I need rest. I'm asking you to accept that answer.
Alter course to Vulcan. Increase speed to warp four.
Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant.
Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance.
I quite understand, Captain.
How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us?
Mister Spock. Come with me, please.
Deck five. You've changed course for Vulcan, Mister Spock. Why?
Do you deny it?
No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible.
Then why'd you do it?
I'm trying to help you, Spock.
Ask me no further questions. I will not answer.
I order you to report to the Sickbay.
Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you.
I think I'm going to get space sick.
Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan.
Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain.
I don't know.
You say you're convinced he knows what it is?
No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order.
It has to do with biology.
What kind of biology?
But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're
Mister Sulu, you don't think
Let me alone. Let me alone!
Well, that's that.
Course already plotted. Laying it in, sir.
I don't understand.
Your face is wet.
My name is Christine.
Oh, I'd be very glad to do that, Mister Spock.
Is it permitted?
I shall be honoured, sir.
Captain. We're standing by on Vulcan hailing frequencies, sir.
This is Spock.
She's lovely, Mister Spock. Who is she?
She is T'Pring. My wife.
It's lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler.
The atmosphere is thinner than Earth.
The marriage party approaches. I hear them.
Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife.
He never mentioned that his family was this important.
This is Kirk.
What is it? What happened?
Think Spock can take him?
I doubt it. Not in his present condition.
No! I am to be the one. It was agreed.
I ask forgiveness.
My friend does not understand.
What happens to Spock if I decline?
You can't do it, Jim.
Jim, listen, if you
What do you mean, if both survive?
You're going to have to kill him, Jim.
McCoy to Enterprise.
I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me.
Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission immediately, of course.
So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements.
Don't you think you better check with me first?
Nurse, would you mind, please?
Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical.
Come on, Spock. Let's go mind the store.
No sign of the inhabitants so far. Kirk out.
Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden?
Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden.
Enterprise, alert! Stand by to beam up landing party.
No, Captain. I can travel.
Bones, can you save him?
On my way. Scotty. Bones?
I don't know yet, Jim.
Good. Go to Yellow Alert.
Yellow Alert. All stations go to Yellow Alert.
I can try, Captain.
Message to Starbase, sir?
Kirk to Sickbay.
So, they've broken the treaty.
Research is not the Klingon way.
Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott.
We've seen different development at rates on different planets.
Then you and I are transporting down.
I can't leave Spock at this time.
And if that's not it?
I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but
I understand. We'll arrange a rendezvous schedule. Kirk out.
Perfect. Tyree's camp's a quarter of a mile away.
Do I have a choice?
They left. Out of orbit.
Tyree. Some of his men. Cure.
Take him to the cave. I bring Tyree.
You and your Garden of Eden.
I took you because you cast a spell upon me.
The night of madness.
Oh, Tyree, did you really hate that madness?
What is it?
The stranger, where is he?
Nona, where's Kirk? The cave?
Tyree, you wish me to save him?
You mean he's conscious?
I am Tyree.
And I'm Tyree's woman.
It is Kirk. She will cure him.
A mahko root.
A plant? It moves.
Bones. I had the strangest dream.
How do you feel, Jim?
She must sleep also.
He is hers?
Yes, James! James, it's good to see you.
Good. It is past time to plan.
And of things to be done.
The readings are beginning to fluctuate.
Do whatever he says?
Have you seen any strangers among the villagers?
Many ways? What else does she know about us?
We're simply strangers from
You will not speak of this to others.
I am grateful.
A splendid custom if not carried to extremes.
No! I said I will not kill!
The guard. We must wait.
Tyree, supposing you had to fight? What then?
You are late, my friend Apella.
A way to shoot further and straighter.
Jim. Coal for forge, sulphur for gun powder.
Let's take a look inside.
Hit you? No! I can't
Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness.
Leave me alone!
Have you gone daft?
That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor.
What's this all about?
Here, let me help you, Mister Spock.
Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered.
Yes, I see you are.
Jim, I want to talk to you.
Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants?
And if the Klingons give their side even more?
Stand by to signal the captain.
You are here because I wished you here.
Oh? I thought it was my idea.
Can you smell this fragrance? Some find it pleasing.
I'd like to talk to you.
Again. Some find it soothing. Yes.
I would like
I feel dizzy. Yes, you are lovely. You're beautiful.
Where's Captain Kirk? Tyree, the firestick. Where is it?
There! I left it there.
I do not want it.
I bring you victory for Apella!
Touch me again, and this small box will kill you.
No, no. I'm all right. My phaser. She took it.
Tomorrow in the palm of her hands.
Well, you got what you wanted.
Spock, are you alive?
I tend to agree.
No, everything is in order, Lieutenant. Stand by.
It's what the doctor ordered, Jim.
Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen?
The ceremony will be carried on all viewing screens, sir.
There was a call for you from the Bridge.
Maintain course to outpost four. Keep me informed. Kirk out.
Our speed is now maximum, sir.
Position, eight minutes from Outpost four at this velocity, sir.
There can't be much doubt who's attacking, sir.
I had no idea that history was your specialty.
Their war, Mister Stiles. Not yours. Don't forget it.
Energise main phasers, Mister Styles. All weapons to full power.
All weapons to full power. Phaser control room.
Sir, regaining contact with Outpost four. Switching to speakers.
Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status?
Can you locate the intruder for us?
Lock us onto your screen.
Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range.
Trying to, sir. They don't acknowledge.
Position of the intruder, Mister Spock.
Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a moment.
Go to full magnification.
Screen is on full mag, sir.
I don't see anything. I can't understand it.
Continuing to challenge, sir. Still no response.
Don't you mean interception course, sir?
Add to that the fact it was a sneak attack.
Mister Stiles, are you questioning my orders?
Picking up communication. It's from their ship.
Pipe it in.
Sounds like code, sir.
Put it on the screen.
Cryptography is working on it, sir.
Give it to Spock.
I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles.
I'm not sure, sir.
Stay with him, helm.
We grow visible. Attend the cloaking system.
My Commander sent for Decius.
A message was dispatched. You've broken the rule of silence.
Danger and I are old companions.
They're turning, sir. We're staying with them.
What's our position, navigator?
Bring it to the briefing room. Are you ready, gentlemen?
Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor.
No question. Their power is simple impulse.
Meaning we can outrun them?
Go ahead, Mister Styles. I called this session for opinions.
We have to attack immediately.
Aim with sensors. Not accurate, but if we blanket them
And if they could report they destroyed us?
Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight?
We know what they look like.
War is never imperative, Mister Spock.
Do you want a galactic war on your conscience?
Captain to Bridge.
What's our position?
Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports?
And at this distance?
Thank you, Lieutenant. Check our course ahead, Mister Spock.
Amen to that. We're taking a big gamble, Jim.
Phaser weapons energised. Set for proximity blast.
Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail.
Plot his exact point of entry, Mister Stiles.
He's maintaining that bearing, Captain.
Let's get him, Mister Sulu.
You spoke of entrapment.
Its many particles will obscure their sensing device, Centurion.
We enter it, Commander.
At last the screen is clear, Commander.
We're losing sensor contact, Captain.
Steady as she goes. Phaser crews ready?
He'll only be visible for a moment. Stand by.
Sir, nothing in
Hard to starboard.
Divert all power to weapons.
It'll take time to correct, sir.
Captain, are they surrendering?
Do we have emergency warp?
Estimate it'll overtake us in two minutes, sir.
Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately.
Ten seconds to impact. Captain, It's dissipating, sir.
It must have a range limit.
Back to his old course.
He may think we're destroyed, Captain.
Same as before, Mister Sulu. Stay with him.
Activate our cloak.
It moves as we move.
Its commander is not one to repeat a mistake.
We'll enter the Neutral Zone in one minute, Captain.
We're still on our side, Captain.
Sir, at this distance?
I'm aware of that, Mister Stiles. Are phasers ready?
Twenty seconds to Neutral Zone, sir.
No need. The Centurion is dead.
Why don't we fire, Commander?
Debris scatter ahead, sir. We've hit him.
Simple debris. Not a vessel, a trick.
Go to sensor probes.
Shh. He is there, somewhere. I feel it.
No, I don't really expect an answer.
It's all right. It's all right.
A signal, Commander.
We have him. Move toward him.
Power on. Reverse course. He'll try to slip under us.
Place one with the debris. Proximity fuse.
More wreckage, sir, scattering across our path.
Debris on our scanners.
Captain to Sickbay.
Sir, my first assignment was in weapons control.
Still no sign of movement, Commander.
We've damaged ourselves. Our fuel reserve is gone.
And it is our duty to crush the Praetor's enemies.
I do not trust their Captain.
We will attack, but on my order.
Will you require assistance here?
This time, we'll handle things without your help, Vulcan.
Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Stiles!
What purpose will it serve to die?
Are you all right, Mister Spock?
I'm all right.
He is Kodos. I'm sure of it.
I did it to trap Kodos!
Kodos is dead.
Is he? Is anyone sure? A body burned beyond recognition?
Then let's reopen it. Jim, four thousand people were butchered.
Kodos is dead. I'm satisfied of that.
Give information on actor Karidian prior to Kodos' death.
No information available, Anton Karidian, prior to twenty years ago
A good empirical research scientist. Steady, reputable, occasionally brilliant.
With a very long memory.
The others are on the patio.
My father will be delighted, Mister. Mister?
We are honoured.
I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally.
An actor turning away his admirers? Very unusual.
Then I'll talk to Lady Macbeth.
So. Captain of the Enterprise. Interesting.
So, Lady Macbeth. Interesting. What's your next move?
Very impressive. Lenore. I'd like to see you again.
You don't have a schedule now, do you?
You mean leave? But I've only just arrived.
And you hate to overstay a welcome.
At the party, you were such a brash young man.
It's Tom Leighton. He's dead.
I don't know. I'll try and find out.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Can you do me a favour?
Transporter room, ready to beam up.
Ready to resume course, Captain.
Tell her to come up to the Bridge, Lieutenant.
How did you know this lady was coming aboard?
I'm the Captain.
Can't you make other arrangements?
It'd be a shame if that happened.
I appeal to you.
The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers.
I'll make a bargain with you, Captain.
What have you got to trade?
Special performance for the crew in exchange for a lift.
Then you'll do it?
May I inquire as to our course, Captain?
Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course.
Data on question submitted to personnel files.
I'm sending him back.
My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol.
It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard.
It occurred. I dismissed it.
Did you order the soft lights especially for the occasion?
It's very old.
You can count on it.
Tell me about the women in your world, Captain.
Tell me about it.
What would you like to know?
I've heard of it.
Unfortunately, he wasn't the first.
What has Karidian to do with it?
His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared.
You think Jim suspects he's Kodos?
Not me. I am down. In the engineering room.
I think his heart is sore.
What can I do for you, Riley?
Well, you're not, and I'll prove it to you.
I'll be back, though it takes forever
Where my heart is
How'd you like that, Riley?
You've got to pull him through.
I'm not sure I can.
Someone tried to poison him.
When I've finished logging it.
Will he make it?
He's got a good chance.
Can we predict the same for you, Captain?
All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it.
Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you.
Someone tried to kill him.
Could have been an accident.
It could happen.
I know what he's doing, and I don't like it.
It's his job, and you know it.
And you also know that nothing is proven.
I'm not. I'm interested in justice.
Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance?
Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum.
You can't stay.
Go on. Block off this section. Hurry. I'll find it.
I hoped you would have respected my privacy, Captain.
I am sorry to hear that.
Do you believe that I am?
You're an actor now. What were you twenty years ago?
I learn my parts very quickly.
Kodos, whoever he was
But he didn't. And history has made its judgment.
Who do I have to be?
I believe we have a match, Captain.
You've made your point, Doctor.
Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I'll go no further.
Speak. I am bound to hear.
Riley, get back to the Sickbay.
He murdered my father, and my mother.
I'm not wrong.
It's an order. Give me the weapon.
Now get back to Sickbay. Go on.
It's going beautifully. What is it? What's wrong?
What are you saying?
What have you done?
What had to be done. They had to be silenced.
All of them? All seven? More blood on my hands?
No Father, not anymore. I'm strong, Father. It's nothing.
Bright as a blade. Come with me, both of you.
The play is over. It's been over for twenty years.
Stop it, Father! You have nothing to justify.
I did it for you. I've saved you.
You cannot deny him his last performance!
You'll never get off the ship.
Caesar, beware the ides of March.
No, child! Don't!
Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain.
Whenever you're ready, Mister Leslie.
You're not going to answer my question, are you?
That's an answer.
And the images we've been seeing are
You're not speaking, yet I hear you.
It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help.
This is Rigel Seven.
Please, we must hide ourselves.
The Talosians controlled his brain.
Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.
But it's only a dream.
You have to kill him as you did here before.
What is it? Why have they stopped the images?
I demand to know why.
If you'll be patient, the answers to your questions
Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.
I can wear whatever you wish, be anything you wish.
You're a fool.
Perhaps if you asked me some questions I could answer.
How far can they control my mind?
But they try to trick me with their illusions.
War, thousands of centuries ago.
That's why it's so barren up there?
Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.
You said that if I answered questions
Why? Just to maintain a supply of zoo specimens?
Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?
And if I prefer
To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment.
That's very interesting.
Now to the female.
You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?
It became necessary to attract a mate.
First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy. Excellent.
Is it good to be home?
Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?
Nice place you have here, Mister Pike.
Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?
No! Let me finish!
We were the only ones transported.
It's not fair. You don't need them.
He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.
Picked her? For what? I don't understand.
Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.
It's not fair. I did what you asked.
Hold still, or I'll break your neck.
Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil.
I've had some samples of how good they are.
Your ship. Release me, or we'll destroy it.
It seems the Talosians have deserted you.
Gentlemen, a moment, please.
Guilty as charged.
Bridge to Commander.
As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing.
I want to contact our ship.
Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves?
What is that?
But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual cooperation.
Let's get back to the ship.
I can't. I can't go with you.
You see why I can't go with you.
This is the female's true appearance.
You'll give her back her illusion of beauty?
Mister Spock, the system is coming on again.
Oh, Jim, I just can't understand this.
If my first officer states he received a transmission from
When he was promoted to Fleet Captain.
About your age. Big, handsome man, vital, active.
What's his problem, Commodore?
Well, that's true of course.
She merely mentioned she knew you, sir.
You have something to report, Miss Piper?
With the flashing light, he can say yes or no.
Enterprise to Starbase. Request confirmation.
I have security clearance, Chief.
This is Mister Spock.
Stand by. We'll warp out of orbit in one hour.
How long will he live?
Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?
I don't read you at all, Jim.
He's also half human.
He would not make a false entry.
Well, what is it? Sickness? Injury? How bad is it?
With a half Vulcan science officer named Spock.
Commodore! Captain Pike, he's gone!
Mendez here. What is it?
The Enterprise knows where she's going, Mister Hansen.
Someone's trying to hail us, sir.
You have your orders, Mister Hansen. We'll make no contact.
Spock is headed for Talos Four, all right.
Lock on to sensors. Measure object now following the Enterprise.
Computed. Shuttlecraft is already past point of safe return.
Two hours of oxygen left.
Spock would have some logical reason for going there.
Maybe. Maybe he's just gone mad.
Computer control. Lock on to shuttlecraft following us.
Go to tape Abel Seven Baker. Execute instructions.
Is it the captain, Mister Spock?
Adequate, Doctor. I'll make no trouble.
All right, Captain. Locked on to you.
Transferring command to you, sir.
Accepting command. Where's Mister Spock?
In his quarters, under arrest.
His quarters, after what he's done, Lieutenant?
Unable to comply.
Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid.
Are your comments a part of the record, sir?
Yes, it's on the record.
Present your evidence. Screen on.
I cannot tell you at this time, sir.
That has nothing to do with it.
The meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain.
Steady as we go.
We aren't going to go, to be certain?
Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.
What makes you think I need one?
Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.
And I vote we do not. Deadlock, and since I'm
We've settled into orbit, sir.
Zero point nine of Earth.
MAN: They're men. They're humans.
The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon.
Yes, affirmative on the
I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
Their health is excellent, almost too good.
I, I don't understand.
You will. You're a perfect choice.
What is it?
Plead signal for you, sir. Go ahead, Uhura.
Sir, I respectfully decline.
It's a native of Capella Four, isn't it?
It is beautiful, but also very deadly.
Hard about, helmsman. Change course for twenty four mark seven.
Captain, that ship is not responding.
Captain, they are making visual contact.
Put it on the screen, Lieutenant.
I've never heard that language before.
No use, sir. She's refusing to answer.
Yes, Scotty, what is it?
Mister Arex, what is our speed?
Sir, I can't release the tractor beam.
What do you mean, Mister Sulu?
Go to manual override.
We are still starship personnel, Captain.
Aye, Captain. Our engines are almost gone.
Contact in thirty nine seconds. Thirty eight, thirty seven
Thirteen, twelve, eleven
Get ready to execute course change, Mister Sulu.
Impossible. It should have been destroyed instantly.
It's got to work.
Fourteen seconds, thirteen, twelve
Never mind, Mister Spock, it's no use.
Where are we?
Yes, Scotty. How are we doing down there?
The alien ship is responding to our call, Captain.
We have little choice.
That would take a remarkable coincidence, Mister Spock.
May I introduce my son, Karl Four.
Then the young child in the playpen
That's true, Captain.
You are welcome to use my ship, Captain.
we just might get you to Babel after all, Commodore.
We're meeting the speed of Karla Five's unmanned vessel, Captain.
How is our course, Mister Sulu?
He's too young, Captain.
Yes, Captain, but who will fill in for you?
What do you mean?
I see what you mean.
Tractor beam? How do we do that, Spock?
Whatever you say. What shall I do?
You are correct, of course. Commodore April, command is yours.
Commodore? I'm Captain April, Mister Spock.
Very good. Assume your post at the navigation console.
Vessel armed, Captain. Nine seconds to impact. Eight, seven,
But the Enterprise crew, they're all children.
I see your flower has blossomed again.
If you would be so kind, Captain.
Slaughter? Hundreds of people?
Let me see that.
That doesn't mean he was responsible for it.
His trial will tell, Captain.
Trial? You mean kangaroo court. I've heard about Dramian justice.
Captain, you're becoming emotional.
Or a tragic mistake on my part.
I don't buy that, Bones. Guard!
There it is.
You are sure?
Estimated time of arrival, Mister Sulu?
Shall I make contact, sir?
You're planning something, Captain?
Unless I miss my guess, that's friend Demos.
What if he attacks, sir?
But the hangar doors aren't open, Captain.
I demand that you report to the Federation now!
I would, but unfortunately we're out of communications range.
You are a stowaway, Commander.
I have been tricked.
You're sure it's safe, Captain?
Decidedly. There's a difference, Captain.
Not the most enchanting place I've ever been to.
Plagues seldom leave behind fields of flowers, Captain.
They do not like outsiders.
Surely you're not an outsider, Commander. You're Dramian.
Inhospitable or not, he mustn't get away.
He's disappeared. It's almost as if he dematerialised.
I would advise against that, Captain.
I'm sure you won't mind if I ignore your advice.
Caution would seem to be advisable, Captain.
Bones' life is on the line, Mister Spock.
Cave dwellers? In the midst of your civilisation?
A result of your Doctor McCoy and his inhumane methods.
You say it, Demos, but that doesn't
But how did he survive the plague?
Then you can tell us. Do you remember?
Let's get underway for Dramia.
Sir, who is that?
I'll pour on the coal, Captain.
Let's hope the trial hasn't started.
Yes, Mister Spock. What is it?
He's hardly fit to testify at the trial, Captain.
We've got to save him.
It is not that. It is
Captain, you're blue.
General Order Six has been activated?
Good. Report to Sickbay, Mister Sulu.
But sir, who will monitor?
I assure you I am capable, Mister Sulu.
We have to get McCoy. Must find an antidote.
Impossible. He too is stricken.
Got to get McCoy.
Doctor, just come with me, please.
Plague? Why didn't you tell me?
I'm a doctor, Spock, a doctor. Get us beamed aboard.
Blast it, Spock, work harder. They're in the terminal stage.
Bones, that's it. Aurora, changing colour.
Jim? Aurora? What
Bones, you did it!
And we'll forget about a certain stowaway.
We must apologise.
What is that supposed to mean?
Hippocrates would not have approved of lame excuses, Doctor.
Captain, I've established contact with the Romulan commander.
I demand an explanation for this unprovoked attack.
Strange. It's not on the charts.
Mister Spock, what are our chances?
After that ride, I could use some repairs.
How are the repairs progressing, Scotty?
How do you like that? So did mine.
I'm beginning to wonder, Bones, I am beginning to wonder.
What have you got there, Spock?
I'm sorry, Spock, it's your
Officer Scott, won't you join us for lunch?
Hey, wait a minute. We didn't cause this to happen.
Okay, this whole thing has gone far enough!
When you all finish laughing, I'd appreciate an explanation.
Captain, I never laugh.
This is no joke, sir.
Amazing. This deck is covered with ice.
The evidence all points to one guilty party, Captain.
You mean you know who's behind these stunts?
Well, what'll it be, a swim at the beach?
Then woods it is.
Ah, now that's more like it. Shall we?
That's strange. Repeat the call.
It's so peaceful. So relaxing.
And best of all, no practical jokes.
What was that?
I'm not sure. It almost sounded like someone chuckling.
There it is again. Someone is definitely laughing at us.
Did I hear that right?
I'll never tell.
Well, I'll be
I suggest compliance, Captain.
Say pretty please with sugar on.
Temper, temper. Perhaps this will cool you off.
Time for a nap, old girl. Captain's orders.
Vacate sir? But
You bloody big scatterbrain. Make up your monumental mind.
What can we do to stop it?
The temperature must be twenty below and its still dropping.
Then let's move before we all turn into icicles.
Come on, Spock. Where's that Vulcan sense of humour?
Hmm. Just as I thought.
Spock, what, what are you mumbling about?
But Doctor, we can't.
Could you turn up the heat?
I'll see what I can
Captain, we're underway.
Engine room reports all engines shut down, yet they're firing.
As soon as our course stabilizes, give me a reading.
We're heading back to the Neutral Zone.
We're decelerating, sir.
Jim, what in heaven's name is going on?
You know as much as I do, Bones.
Wait a minute. There is a method to this madness.
Please elaborate, Captain.
Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is seeking revenge?
Commander, there's no radio response from the large ship.
Very well, it has refused surrender. Advance at attack speed.
The Romulans are giving chase.
Yes, Captain. Our course will take us nowhere near it.
Good! I couldn't face going through there again.
It petrifies me.
No! We can't!
My circuits! You tricked me, Kirk. How could you?
What the devil is going on?
It's not fair.
The controls are responding now.
Yes, but later. Let's not spoil their fun just yet.
Kirk Captain, settings are almost complete.
Commander Bem, what are you doing here?
This one has already set controls, Mister Scotty.
Assistance is offered.
We're all right.
He won't get far in there.
He would have had to go through here to escape.
I think we've lost him. That way.
Yes, and the food they have gathered is Bem.
We're talking about the Captain.
Our phasers don't work either.
An alternate course of action would appear to be advisable.
One of us could go back to contact Mister Scott.
Commander Bem seems to be a model prisoner.
We'll have to wait until nightfall.
Shut up. We're rescuing you.
You are interfering with observations.
This is how you observe, by being captured?
As logical a way as any, Spock Commander.
How come we always end up like this?
I believe that is the correct Earth term.
Why don't you try your Vulcan nerve pinch.
Captain, I am only a Vulcan. There are limits.
Either one could solve our problems right now.
Compliance with orders is. This one must disassemble.
Remarkable. Commander Bem is a colony creature.
Lieutenant Arex, have you found them yet?
No, sir. It is a big planet.
We can't get any readings at all now.
No, do not use your weapons.
We're held in stasis, Captain.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Why are you here? Why do you disturb this place?
Have you found the Captain yet?
Perhaps an offering of some sort, Captain.
I am here.
This is good. Go. Go now and do not return.
He has fled.
Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise.
Captain, are you all right?
Not on my ship you don't.
He is found, and we will leave.
No, do not destroy yourself.
You do not demand punishment?
I am humbled.
We will go now.
Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up.
Pandro will respect that also.
Captain, I compliment you on a wise decision.
Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Let's go home.
Captain, I'm picking up a message.
Put it on audio, Lieutenant Uhura.
Kirk to Sickbay. Emergency!
Get to the point, Bones.
Spock has contracted the disease. It's fatal to Vulcans.
Are you sure?
The result is suffocation.
How long can Spock last without the drug?
What will the symptoms be, Bones?
You wished to see me, sir?
No, it won't.
Will that be all, Captain?
One other thing. I've cut your duty time in half.
Captain, that won't be necessary. I'm quite able
That's all, Spock. Dismissed.
It'll hurt seeing him like that.
Sir, our sensors are picking up a ship ahead.
Time to rendezvous, Mister Arex?
I hate to ask, but
What is it, Bones?
I was conserving energy, Captain.
McCoy wants you in Sickbay.
This won't hurt a bit, Spock.
An unnecessary assurance, Doctor, in addition to being untrue.
Such restraint would be welcome.
Well, that's not too bad. Back to work, Mister Spock.
The drug isn't working any more.
They've increased speed, sir, closing fast.
Try ship to ship.
Sensor report, Mister Spock. Are they at the rendezvous point?
No, sir. They hadn't reached it.
Compute new course, Mister Arex. Let's see what's going on.
Based on present data, I would say yes.
Spock, are you all right?
Bridge to Sickbay. Emergency.
Do what you can, Bones.
Still unable to make contact, sir.
Scott to Captain Kirk.
Good. Nurse, how is he?
He needs surgery, Captain, but he'll live.
How is he, Bones?
We're following the intruder ship's trail.
We don't even know it it's the right one.
It's got to be.
Increase speed to warp eight.
Deflectors up. Yellow Alert. Cut speed to warp one.
What was that?
Also make quite a weapon. Steady as she goes, Sulu.
Hard to port, Sulu. Let's face them head on.
I recognise the ship's markings, Captain. It's an Orion.
They're hailing us, Captain.
Put it on visual, Lieutenant.
Hold on that, Uhura. Tell them to stand by.
Sensors picking up the dilithium in their hold, sir.
Kirk to Sickbay.
Bones, how much time?
The Orions are hailing us, sir.
Put it on the screen, Lieutenant.
Do you have a counterproposal?
Face to face? Where?
It's got to be a trap, Jim.
No doubt of it, sir.
You've already made up your mind, haven't you, Jim.
If this doesn't work, we could lose you and Spock.
If we don't try, Spock doesn't have a chance.
You're saying we can't escape?
Do you have a plan, Lieutenant?
What will it take?
Enterprise to Orion vessel.
I accept your terms.
Jim, we don't have a lot of time. Spock
The drug, as promised, Captain. Scan it if you wish.
You can't escape the Enterprise.
But we can destroy it.
What is it?
There's dilithium down there with them, sir.
But so will yours.
Captain, it was close.
Let's get up to the Bridge.
They're gone, sir.
I have the Orion vessel, sir.
Spock, there's no way you can deny it.
Doctor McCoy, I
I still prefer my physiological structure to yours.
Yes, gentlemen, things are back to normal.
A religious leader, was he not?
Our Soul, the Soul of the Skorr, was stolen.
Is there any clue to its location?
Then it is done.
I cannot feel the Soul. We are nowhere near it.
It has directional equipment that keys on indurite.
I like this place, it's got variety.
Our direction is indicated.
Why did the Vedala call this the Mad planet?
Means nothing. I can tell the way. That way.
Are you certain, human?
I will scout overhead.
I wouldn't say that. Mister Spock is a unique personality.
Fascinating. But we're not here on a pleasure trip, Lara.
Against what? There's no life on this planet.
And a half.
A statistical probability.
Yes. But philosophy and poetry are not appropriate here.
A lava flow. Volcanic action is to be expected.
I heard him.
Carefully, Em. One missed connection could destroy us.
I figure we've bought ourselves a little time. Few minutes.
Leave, all of you.
Captain, you must get the others away.
We're all getting away.
Oh! And I was just going to ask, what next?
We move on.
We'll have to carry the equipment.
Come on, Em, a bit more.
Sorry, Em. We'll be needing you. Sord.
I'll go ahead.
What is it?
There is no life on this planet.
Guess you're right. This planet just gets on your nerves.
Tchar, be careful. We need you, too.
Sord, what did you think you saw back there?
There should be no life on this planet.
Maybe the Vedala didn't know about it.
That is an impossibility.
Think so? I'm not so sure.
That's it. End of a long, hard journey.
I already have a lot of green memories.
Is this not the shape of your people's primitive temples?
What is it?
Keep working. I'll cover you.
We'll hit Tchar.
What happened to Tchar?
We could rest awhile. Lara?
No. We've come this far.
Pretty. How do we reach it?
The walls are not climbable.
You're not exactly surprised.
Maybe I can get a line on it.
Spock, will our combined phasers disrupt the field?
I cannot define the field's energy base, Captain, but
Tchar. In the name of the Seven Gods, why?
Now you can fly and fight as a Skorr.
No offence, little ones, but let me tackle him.
Last week with you, Captain.
Call for retrieval, now.
Let me die.
You're going back with us.
What about Tchar? How are you going to punish him?
What do you mean?
How long were we gone?
Long? About two minutes, I guess. I don't understand.
It was against all orders.
The need was apparently desperate.
You Vulcans are the most impossible, unimaginative
Bones, that's not helping the situation.
According to their lot, they beamed down six weeks ago.
Careless of me, Mister Spock. Planetary life forms?
Jim, if the others are lost, why take the risk?
It's still a risk.
Then we'll beam back up.
It may be able to navigate on land.
I know it can.
Let's get out of here.
Strange you didn't get a voice reply.
There could be many reasons why we did not.
Concentrate on the underside of the neck.
I am undamaged. Where is Doctor McCoy?
We'll get you out, Bones.
Thanks. The air was running out under there.
Were you hurt?
Captain, the beast, did it seem familiar to you?
My shoes are full of sand.
Doctor, your lack of scientific interest is amazing.
I've seen stranger things, Mister Spock.
Kirk to Enterprise.
I don't know. But at least they're alive.
Apparently alive. We cannot be sure.
I choose to believe they are.
Allow me to test the water first, Doctor.
Captain, the water is too pure.
Nonetheless, it is too pure.
In other words, it's too good to be true.
Terraforming isn't new. It implies intelligent life forms.
Unless, of course, the random choice is the pattern.
Spock, do you ever say anything straight out?
Gentlemen, please. We have work to do.
We're still alive, aren't we?
If that's true, Spock, then
We've been travelling for hours. Where are they taking us?
Captain, there it is.
That must be five square kilometres.
If these are the builders, it is an admirable feat.
Congratulations, Doctor. A most logical assumption.
And we are definitely on the inside.
Surely we can communicate with them some way.
You mean it's some kind of a zoo?
Or maybe they want to see how our toys work.
That too is a possibility.
We've got to communicate with them.
Well, so much for mythology.
This is real grass.
A zoo? I'm no animal.
We've been expecting you.
We heard your communicator signal.
Then why didn't you warn us?
There were six of you on the mission.
I'll check her out. Maybe I can help.
What have you learned about the aliens?
Have you tried an escape?
Have you tried to communicate?
We seem to have company.
You seem to be getting a response.
My impression is that they are laughing at me.
Captain Kirk, Mister Spock, this is Nancy Randolph, our navigator.
How is she?
The Lactrans outside, what do they do?
Do they feed us or do we shift for ourselves.
Always to the same place?
Then my equipment should be there.
Then think about it that way, Doctor.
Food. But it's not feeding time.
It's all here. They haven't damaged it.
What's your evaluation of the situation, Markel?
A natural reaction for the curators of a zoo.
How? We can't get through to them?
They communicate telepathically.
Between themselves, yes, but, Mister Spock, aren't Vulcans telepathic?
How much have you learned?
What's their impression of us?
How about coming up with another move, then?
If I may suggest, sir?
It's a little one. Could be a child.
Enterprise, this is Captain Kirk. Beam us aboard.
I'm worried about the Enterprise.
Well, let's not stand here. Let's do something.
The best thing we can do is Argh!
What is it?
I think it's harmless, but I'm not sure.
Whatever it wants me to.
Jim, are you all right?
Yes. I think so.
I can't hold out against that many.
I'm all right. Scotty, what are you doing here?
It made contact with me.
What did you learn?
Then how did you get here?
What else do they know about us?
Do we get out of here?
Everyone ready to transport?
Offhand, I'd say we learned to keep our hands off.
But there was so much more.
We'll be welcome back, in twenty or thirty centuries.
Either way, Mister Spock, it will hardly be our problem.
Why is it glowing like that?
Mister Sulu, what is our position?
Maybe no one else was carrying a stasis box detector.
Bring us about. We'll investigate the Beta Lyrae system.
We are not tourists here, Lieutenant.
Where are we?
A Kzinti spacecraft.
Then you're really working for the Kzinti government.
Could that be a picture of a Slaver?
The human, Sulu, believes it to be a Slaver.
Mister Spock, I can move.
So can I. The police web is off.
Mister Spock, we
I have the weapon.
No, they cannot. Or rather, will not.
But we've seen all the phases.
It may be the key to another setting.
Wrong. They don't think much of you.
No. Let's see what this does do.
We can't give them that!
I have no idea. It is generating power.
It has the Kzinti frightened.
The Kzinti have legends of weapons haunted by their owners.
Without certain code words, I may not describe our location.
Twist me widdershins until you reach the null position. Then
They've got it.
There must be something we can do.
That was not the total conversion beam setting.
We can't let them have that weapon.
They are not about to get it, Lieutenant.
A disrupter field.
At this rate, they'll never get over those old superstitions.
What the devil was that thing?
It's regaining consciousness. Surface, Mister Clayton.
Spock, prepare to fire phasers.
Kirk to Enterprise. Emergency.
We're under attack. Beam us aboard, Scotty.
Repeat, we've lost contact. Come in, Captain. Come in.
There's nothing. There's just nothing.
Maybe they're still alive.
Their bodies are functioning. Metabolism, heart. Everything but the lungs.
Can't breathe. Suffocating. Help. Can't breathe.
What happened to them, Doctor? What is it?
Are you sure the mutation wasn't somehow accomplished naturally?
It's highly sophisticated and completely unknown to us.
That implies there are intelligent life forms on Argo.
What about you, Spock? What does your logic tell you?
We'll make contact as soon as possible, Mister Scott.
Go away, air breathers. You're not wanted here.
We won't harm you. We're friends.
I don't understand. They said they'd saved us once.
That building in the centre. It seems to be important.
Can we do nothing without consulting the ancient records?
Rila is correct. You may speak.
You do not live on the surface places?
Not on this world.
Scott here. What is it, Doctor?
Can you contact them sooner?
Yes. Let us examine the wreckage before we make judgement.
We have news, High Tribune.
Do you still believe these creatures came in peace?
We do not know what to believe.
Go to the big island. Bring assistance party.
Did you see anything?
Not a sign of them. Wait a minute. Who are
That suggests your race evolved from its ancient enemies.
Strange that such a highly developed race would be violent.
Then reverse mutation is possible.
How far are the ruins, Rila?
There's another chamber.
What's the composition of the antitoxin, Bones?
Nephro, we must break the ordainments.
Quickly, we must leave.
No, no, there is no time.
Well, let's get started.
How do you feel, Jim?
A little dizzy. Otherwise normal.
I did not believe such knowledge was possible.
Major tremors will start in three minutes, Captain.
It is incredible. All of it.
Fire phasers as directed, gentlemen.
Then our people are safe.
The seabed should stabilize within a few hours.
Don't lose contact with each other like your ancestors.
We will pass ordainments to forbid it.
And we, this time, will not ignore them.
Nonetheless, let's have it on the record.
Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk.
Sir, aren't we going to defend ourselves?
Your deflector shields are doing that for us, Mister Scott.
Dead on, sir. We'll be there in ten seconds.
Captain, our deflector shields have just gone out.
Subspace radio channels are dead, sir.
Where did they go?
I can't tell, sir. Vision won't focus.
Where are we, sir?
Aye, and where is that tricky devil?
Scanners indicate the Enterprise shields are totally depleted, sir.
Sir, our weaponry is frozen.
Welcome to Elysia. Devna, Interpreter of Laws.
How did you freeze my weaponry?
We are getting out.
Then we'd better do it pretty quick, Captain.
If we find an answer, it will still take time.
That's just what we haven't got.
It's our dilithium crystals, sir. They're deteriorating rapidly.
Got any miracles in your computer, Spock?
Impossible to predict, Captain.
What do you see beyond your eyes, Magen?
Gently, good Magen. Return to us now.
It is impossible.
Have you covered every possibility? Every factor?
Jeopardising his crew and his ship unnecessarily?
But this involves combining our ship with the Klothos.
That is correct.
Good. I'll contact Kor right away.
What is it?
It is not against our laws to try to escape.
Even if they die?
It is their choice.
Forgive me, Commander. I was overcome by the moment. Goodbye.
The stories of his being half human must be true.
Perhaps the time continuum affected his mind.
I wonder if we all haven't become affected.
I would think my commander had manoeuvred brilliantly.
And it can be arranged, practically speaking?
Beg your pardon, sir.
What is it, Gabler.
We were lost.
Jim, I'm worried about Spock. He's just not acting normal.
He's under a lot of pressure, Bones.
I'll talk to him, Bones. It's all I can do.
Yes, Captain. Why do you ask?
You have the device, Kaz?
You could go. We're willing to take passengers.
We believe it can be done.
Then I shall not interfere with your dream, Captain.
Get away from here, human. This is my woman.
You will fail.
You would take these renegades with you?
We need them.
Ready to accelerate to warp six.
Enterprise, this is Xerius! Come in, Enterprise.
Sir, Xerius is calling us. He says it's urgent.
It will go off when you reach warp eight.
There it is, sir.
It doesn't matter, Bones.
That's what matters.
Arachna is entering its cycle of strongest emissions, Captain.
Put it on the speaker.
Signals appear random. Perhaps some are beyond our reception capability.
Could be a natural radio source newly energised by
Intersat? That's been out of use for two centuries.
No, sir. It was repeated twice in the transmission.
Mister Sulu, lay in a course for Cepheus.
It's a waste of time if you ask me.
Set for a single elliptic orbit.
Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, how are your engines?
Purring like happy kittens, Captain.
Nothing, Jim. The gossamer mice show no signs of shock.
Don't know yet.
But dilithium molecules are the hardest, most rigid
Mister Scott! More trouble with the circuit work.
You sound like you're blathering, man. Wait, I'm coming.
Spock, are you slumping?
Captain, the most incredible thing is happening.
We know. The whole ship has apparently expanded.
Only that it is complex beyond anything in my experience.
Kirk here. How are they holding out, Scotty?
Kirk to Sickbay.
Bones, I need some answers. What's happening to us?
There's the test tissue, Jim, compared with the stable infrared.
Then Spock's theory is right. We're contracting.
Agreed. And it is accelerating.
How long can it keep on?
Miss Chapel, what is the composition of this decoration?
Aren't all our uniforms xenylon?
Yes, and they've all been shrinking proportionately with us.
That means only organic matter is affected. But how?
The strands wouldn't break, Jim, they'd just quit winding.
Then we can calculate the limits to our shrinkage.
It's possible. I'll feed the data into the computer banks.
Spock, how small will we ultimately shrink?
Sulu! I think his leg's broken. We'll need a splint.
Let's get him to Sickbay. Every one back to stations.
It's certainly worth a try.
It's in the lab shelf supplies. I'll get it.
No more climbing heights for you, Nurse. Got that clear?
Yes, Captain. But I've also got the miniature laser.
How is it, Sulu?
I can feel it knitting, sir.
Results on DNA reduction limits have come through, Captain.
What are they?
Factor of thirty two point nine.
Yes, Captain. Well past the operative point of Enterprise controls.
It's as good a place as any to beam down.
Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, can you hear me?
I think I see
Scotty, is it you?
Captain, you'll deafen us for sure!
You forbid me after what you've done to my people?
Where are my officers?
Spock, who are the Terratins? Where'd they come from?
Bridge crew, prepare to beam up.
Subspace radio now operational, sir. Starbase Twenty Three is reading.
Mister Arex, prepare for immediate departure from this area.
We came rather close to making it more than honorary.
Do you think Harry Mudd is down there, Spock?
Why can't you just say, Mudd's probably there.
I just did, Doctor.
Harry, darling. I was lonely for you.
Please, darling, come back to the ship with me.
Three hundred credits, or the
I surrender myself with free will. Mercy of the law.
Fine. I'll see you in court, Harry.
A minor bruise, Captain. He'll live.
And came here to swindle honest miners.
Your Mister Spock is really a very attractive intelligence.
What is it?
Think about it, darling. Mister Spock in love with you.
I'll let you know the results of my analysis.
What is it?
A temporary effect as the liquid is absorbed.
I feel better.
Didn't I tell you?
You should, you should be in the Brig, Harry.
Oh, right you are, darling.
Are you injured, Miss Chapel?
No. No, I, I'm fine. Are you feeling all right?
Wouldn't you like me to, well, stay? Help you?
That would be illogical, Miss Chapel.
Yes. Yes, It'd be stupid.
Harry Mudd, you swindling
I've come to collect on your guarantee, Mister Mudd.
You're implying the potion was not completely successful?
Put it on screen.
Mudd. And he has Christine. She's in danger. My love.
He's going planet side.
No. Not with my Christine.
Spock, you're obviously not yourself. Maybe some rest.
Then I'll transport down with you.
Jim, is that wise, in his condition?
Jim, the search party found this in the shuttlecraft bay.
One of Mudd's love crystals.
Lucky for us they don't work.
Check it out, Bones. Send me an immediate report.
Well, I hadn't planned on it.
Thanks Jim. It's good to have a friend like you.
Darling, are you all right?
Kirk, get us out of here.
They're not responding.
Don't worry. You'll be safe, darling.
They're coming closer.
That's my affair.
I think we should get a few things straight.
Yes, we have to control our emotional reactions.
How long does the effect of the potion last, Harry?
Harry, do you have any of the crystals left?
I made contact.
May I help you record his confession, Nurse?
You? You'd be the last person I'd choose.
I can guarantee it.
Yes, just as beautiful as I remembered it. Nothing's changed.
Thank you so very much.
It's hard to believe they're not real.
Lovely. They just don't make them like that anymore.
Off with his head. Off with his head!
Uhura to Transporter room. What is the emergency? Respond, please.
I see. Bones, were you thinking about that book?
Mister Sulu, did you experience any strange occurrences?
His quarters are somewhere underground, aren't they?
Any indication of where that would be?
You are being detained so your master will not leave.
That is your name for it.
Why do you think the Enterprise is my master?
Your questioning is redundant.
That is a word meaning to cease to function?
This planet is built like a fortress.
Enterprise, do you read me?
Scott to Bridge. Beam down of phaser bore commencing.
Scott to Bridge. We've got problems.
There's an inscription, several languages.
Well, gentlemen, it appears that we're on our own now.
Programmes have been changed before, Lieutenant.
Please believe me. There's no reason to harm them.
They serve the sky machine, but they are not essential.
Oh, but they are. They're most essential.
Do not attempt to disconnect me.
You sound less than enchanted with your function.
What do you want, signs pointing the way?
Doctor, I only meant it seems like we're wasting time.
I'm sorry, Sulu. I'm worried about Uhura.
Phasers are dead! Run for the cave!
Our amusement park no longer seems content to amuse.
Please, call off that beast. Why are you doing this?
Mister Arex, what are you doing?
I believe you may know the answer to that, Doctor.
Me? What are you talking about?
And whether it wants to or not.
Perfect, Bones. Which arm do you want?
I submit, Captain, that I am the more qualified subject.
My knowledge of computers for one thing.
And his tough Vulcan hide for another.
Both your arguments seem sound. Go ahead, Bones.
I believe you will find ten cc's adequate.
It's been almost five minutes, Captain.
It looks like some kind of mechanical nursemaid.
Not in my wildest dreams would I think of that!
We have a visitor.
We've got to make those rocks. It's our only chance.
I presume you are the planet's master computer.
What happened to the Keeper?
He was old. He ceased to function.
Sky machines? Slaves? What are you talking about?
A new computer!
It's a dead end!
You are masters of the sky machine?
This is a shock.
Mister Scott, all systems are now functioning normally.
We must have more of these discussions while you're here.
Mister Spock, would you care to take on that duty?
I would find it most interesting, Captain.
Then it's agreed. Kirk to Enterprise.
Reverse power. Hold our position. Deflector screens on.
Deflectors up. Sir, it's taking considerable power to hold position.
Everything can be repaired, Captain.
An incredible experience, Captain. I find this scientifically fascinating.
We'll ride her through, Bones. What else can we do?
Ride her through where?
Where are we?
Captain, the subspace radio. It's dead.
Even the ship's chronometers have stopped.
Ship's life support systems fading. Jim, we need oxygen.
Jim, we've got to do something.
Ah, humans. Lovely primitive humans. Can't you do anything right?
Everything is working, my friends.
It cannot. It is not logical.
Look around you, Spock. Everything is working.
Welcome! I knew eventually humans would come searching for me.
Who are you?
I find this all quite absorbing, Doctor.
Probably because you're not very natural to begin with, Spock.
Children will play.
Our universe operates by what you superstitiously call magic.
I know this is just my imagination but
A love philter?
What is it? What's wrong?
Captain Kirk, what
Everyone onboard is all right?
Mister Scott, I'm bewildered, that's all. But that's enough.
If Lucien put it there
Weapons status, Mister Scott? We may have to protect ourselves.
Forget it, Spock. It won't work.
What are you doing?
Learning to protect ourselves, Lucien.
But you made mistakes, used your powers
And burned for it. Burned!
And loneliness and fear
I will, Asmodeus. I am not of Earth.
Yes, you are different. The court will hear a defence.
I call Lucien as my first witness.
Indeed, Captain. Could you elaborate?
Submit, Captain. You haven't the power to fight us.
Captain, use the magic you know. Believe.
I don't understand.
All systems go, Captain. We're back to normal.
Does it really matter?
Life readings are confused, sir. I can't decipher them.
What is it, Mister Sulu?
You're going to have to see this yourself, sir.
What is that thing?
Ow! Must have been a thorn.
He's been poisoned. Unknown toxin.
Can you help him?
I can't get a correlation with any known poison.
That won't be necessary.
Who are you?
I am called Agmar. I believe we can help.
Are you getting a reading on them?
A moment, Captain. The results are unclear.
Captain, these beings are of botanical origin.
So it would seem.
Welcome to the planet Phylos.
What happened to him?
A minor achievement.
There have been humanoid aliens here before.
Your method of communication
Come. I will show you.
We had no way of knowing what was happening.
You were alive then?
They won't work on any setting, sir.
I think it's after you, Jim.
Kirk to Enterprise.
What do you think they'll do with us, sir?
I'm sorry, Captain Kirk, but there was no other way.
What are you talking about? Where have they taken Spock?
Where is Spock?
Not without my First Officer.
Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up, Scotty.
I'd hate to resort to clubs and knives.
Aye, sir, but I don't like it.
Neither do I, but it appears to be necessary. Energise.
I'm not sure I can take too much of this.
I can't believe it.
Looks like they're getting ready to go on a trip.
Agmar said they were a peaceful people.
Sure they are, now. But what about before?
Any indication of Keniclius or Spock?
Carry on your work?
What if something happens to Spock or the Master?
Just like that, Captain?
The way is though here, gentlemen.
Did you hear something?
I'm not sure.
Not much further now, Captain.
They don't operate. Agmar!
I see it. I see it. Keep going.
He's dying. Something's happened to his brain. Electrical activity decreasing.
Captain, I'm out. The chemical sprayer is empty.
Out of my way, mister. That's an order.
It's no use, Mister Scott. I can't get through.
That's our ship calling, Spock. You answer them.
Spock is slipping away. There isn't much time left.
I'm sure we're getting through, but they're not acknowledging.
That's what I call close, Mister Scott.
Let's hope it was information they could use.
No! The mould must be broken.
SPOCK: I do not believe so.
No! Our dream must not be allowed to die.
Murderer! You've killed Spock!
Spock. Spock, you old
I would be honoured. If I will be allowed.
Inscrutable? Sulu, you're the most scrutable man I know.
Have you identified the vessel, Mister Spock?
That's impossible, Spock. Carter Winston's been missing over five years.
Incredible. It is him.
It seems you gentlemen know me.
My fiancee? Anne's aboard this starship?
Spock is right as usual, Bones.
Are you suggesting I'm not quite human, Doctor?
The Captain is inquiring if the examination is completed, Doctor.
Yes, I suppose so.
I'm sorry, Anne. I never thought we would meet again.
Carter, what is it?
But you did survive. You're alive, and we're together again.
I hope I'm not intruding, Captain.
No, please come in, Mister Winston.
Weren't you going to your cabin, sir?
Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three.
That was the order, helmsman.
An admirable mission, Captain, but if we endanger our ship
That has been his reputation.
You have the conn, Mister Spock.
I'll take the conn, Mister Spock.
I believe that was the reason you gave, Captain.
Perhaps Doctor McCoy should examine you, Captain.
Doctor, what do I do? I still love him.
I haven't. What can I do?
What can I do for you, Captain?
I want a complete medical examination, Bones. Something's just happened
There are not many places one could hide in here.
I must have taken a little nap.
There's something wrong about this room.
I don't think so, Doctor.
I saw that, but I don't believe it.
Spock to Bridge. Put me on ship's audio.
Anne, what are you doing?
Lieutenant Nored, you could've stopped him. Why didn't you fire?
Bridge, this is the Captain. What's happened?
It was not deliberate, I assure you.
I'd like a few minutes to inform my crew.
It would seem so.
I will not surrender my ship.
What are you doing?
Captain, our deflector shields are coming down.
Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, what's happened to the shields?
Mister Scott isn't here, sir.
We need him. Override the controls and shut those doors.
How long will it take to fix?
Carter? What did he say?
How did he die?
You are so much like him, his voice, his mannerisms.
He did say he loved me.
But unfortunately, I can't.
Without deflectors, we're just a clay pigeon for them.
Practicality does suggest capitulation, Captain.
Captain, the deflector shields are coming up again.
That's only one shield.
Yes, sir, but it is between us and the Romulans.
Will someone tell me what's going on?
What manner of beastie is that?
I assume the danger to your ship is over.
Why did you do it?
What changed your mind about the Romulans?
What will happen to me now?
Captain, could you assign me that duty.
But you've seem me. You know what I am.
I don't know. I
You have the guard detail, Lieutenant.
They're firing on him.
They got him.
Scotty, have you got that pilot yet?
Our engines are dead.
The phasers don't work, sir.
Well, we could always throw rocks.
Scotty, did you get that pilot?
But I can't integrate him. The system's been discoordinated.
Captain, I have a message coming in, sir.
Put it on the viewscreen.
Release my ship.
What was that? Lieutenant, cut off that frequency.
They still have power? We still control them?
Captain, you can't afford to lose that grain.
Incredible. The amount of energy that field must require.
They couldn't maintain the stasis field.
Apparently their battle capacity is down. They only damaged it.
They're veering off.
Scotty, can you integrate that pilot now?
I think so, Captain.
Call McCoy to the Transporter room. Spock.
Have you got him?
It appears to be
I don't want to think about it.
And he's got tribbles with him. Tribbles!
Captain, these are safe tribbles.
There's no such thing as a safe tribble.
Well, at least it's neat.
Why were the Klingons chasing you, Jones?
How should I know? Klingons have notoriously bad tempers.
They did mention ecological sabotage.
Me? A saboteur? Ridiculous.
Captain Koloth was pretty emphatic.
What did you do?
Well, I didn't know it was a Klingon planet.
Captain, couldn't we talk this over? I didn't think so.
He really doesn't seem the saboteur type, Jim.
Captain, sensors are picking up a Klingon battle cruiser.
Captain Koloth is quite a marksman.
They've changed course. They're coming in again.
Perhaps they haven't had enough time to recharge it.
Or the purpose of the attack was something else.
Well, Mister Spock, do you have any ideas?
We could always throw tribbles at them.
I thought Vulcans didn't have a sense of humour.
We don't, Captain.
Any sign of Captain Koloth's ship?
Mister Jones, you are in enough trouble already.
Captain, a harmless little tribble. What can they hurt?
They're hungry, Captain.
Captain, the Klingons are coming back.
Speak of the devil.
Jim, there's something about these tribbles.
That's done it. We're caught.
Not if I can help it.
Aren't you going to sit down, sir?
I think I'll stand.
Mister Scott, we're going to implement Emergency defence plan B.
You don't know yet, do you?
You must have others.
Jones sold before they completely overrun the planet.
And that's all you want?
We must have the glommer.
I withdraw my claim.
Captain, the engine room is filled with tribble.
Five seconds. Four, three
Put it on ship's speaker.
It's more like music than a message.
Captain, we are being probed.
From where? Can you trace it?
Can you identify it?
It seems to be calling us.
Strange. Yes, I get the same feeling myself.
It does resemble a summons.
I find no resemblance to a summons, Captain.
You wanted me, Lieutenant? Are you all right?
Logically, we must assume they are created by the probe.
Sir, what visions? We don't see anything.
Miss Chapel, you don't see anything, either?
No, I don't think so, Carver. Spock will do it.
There is something compelling about it.
Yes, I feel it too, Bones.
There's no apparent danger, Spock. Let's go.
They are here.
Oh, such wondrous ones. They honour us.
How do you know our names?
The signal? A distress call, wasn't it?
Take them to the slumber chambers. They must rest.
Probably that nectar. It's potent as Saurian brandy.
Summation of medical, biological, astrophysical scans.
Lieutenant Uhura to Security Officer Davison.
What are you doing?
Taking command of this ship.
We must return to our duties aboard ship.
Yes. Duties. That's it. Duties. I have
We must go.
Very thoughtful of you, love.
I wonder why they let me keep it.
Perhaps they saw no practical use in it.
Cortropine. Could help. It's a strong stimulant.
The urn. It's the only place.
They are not here, Theela.
You mean they're actually draining our life forces?
How long do we have, Spock?
We seem to be aging ten years per day, Captain.
Ten years? In four days, we'll be dead!
Spock to Enterprise.
Greetings. I am Theela. Head Female of this compound.
Return to your ship. You are not wanted here.
Until we find Captain Kirk, we will not leave.
Search the temple. Parties of two.
No sign of them anywhere.
What is it?
It is Spock. There must be a panel somewhere.
We've got to get out of here.
We tried that.
Wait! I will tell you everything.
We shall see. The men of the Enterprise, reveal them.
They're drowning! Where are they?
The nearest water accumulation is many cusecs from here.
That looks like a pool or a tub.
It is the urn in the garden.
No results, Captain. We've tried everything we know.
Perhaps the transporter is the key.
Key to what?
But this has never been done before. Suppose it fails?
Scotty, we're losing them!
Did it work?
You're more handsome than ever.
Tell Captain Kirk we have kept the agreement.
How quickly will we become as other women?
Doctor McCoy says it should only take a few months.
Captain, we are now approaching sensor range of the cloud.
Put up our present position, Lieutenant Arex.
Captain, Alondra has disappeared from navigation scan.
The cloud could have come between us and the planet.
Spock, is it possible the cloud consumes planets?
Sir, the cloud is changing course.
But if it continues on that course
How much time do they have?
It's certain there'd be planetwide panic.
Who's the governor of Mantilles, Jim?
Captain, I'm getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors.
It's still got us.
Prepare to fire all phasers into cloud mass.
Firing. No effect, Captain
The cloud appeared to absorb the phaser energy, Captain.
We're floating inside the cloud.
The objects are some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter.
Scotty, prepare the shields for an antimatter charge.
Transfer it to my quarters.
You have time to save some people, Bob.
How are you going to choose?
We've reached the entrance to the central core, Captain.
What do we do now, knock?
What are those things?
How much time do we have?
Increase deflector shields to maximum.
Screens to maximum, sir.
Scotty, we've got ten minutes left.
The force field is holding. Let's go.
Where is the brain located?
Captain, this is a living creature. Starfleet regulations
I believe that is what I just said, Doctor.
Kirk to Engineering.
Incoming message, sir. It's Governor Wesley of Mantilles.
Put it on the viewscreen, Lieutenant.
Thirty one minutes and four seconds to Mantilles, sir.
Bob, where's Katie?
Don't worry, Bon. She'll be all right. Goodbye.
Can you do it in time?
Twenty six minutes exactly to Mantilles, sir.
The procedure is ready, sir.
How near is Mantilles, Mister Arex?
Awaiting your order, Captain.
The cloud has stopped, sir.
Spock, you did it! The cloud is leaving.
Mister Sulu, let's get out of here, through that grid.
Spock, what did you perceive?
The wonders of the universe, Captain. Incredible, completely incredible.
The travellers are returning.
What do you mean, who's he? You know Mister Spock.
Afraid I don't, Jim.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Who are you?
No, but if it's reality, what happened?
But something was changed.
Did you also research the Vulcan family history requested?
That is not correct.
It is in this case.
Twenty to thirty Vulcan years past.
The date was
The twentieth day of Tasmeen.
How do you know this?
This cousin, what was his name?
Spock, did Selek look like you do now?
I hear all.
It is possible if no other major factor is changed.
Andorians are not known for their charity.
The time and place are ready to receive you.
SPOCK: That is not true. My father
Peace and long life. You are of my family?
I am honoured. Is something wrong, Cousin?
A family resemblance to our forefathers, no doubt.
You seem to understand him better than my husband.
But tomorrow is the twentieth day of Tasmeen.
I seem to have lost track of time.
Sarek, our son and the visitor are gone.
You don't think he'd harm Spock?
It was my duty, Spock.
SPOCK: Mother says you should always say thank you.
The lady Amanda is known for her graciousness.
I dare say you will. Come now.
That is your father's wish?
SPOCK: How did you know?
SPOCK: Is he dying?
SPOCK: I can bring a healer here.
The hour is late. I trust your errand is urgent?
You are Spock, son of Sarek, are you not?
SPOCK: Healer, please hurry.
It will not be long now, old friend.
A Vulcan would face such a loss without tears.
SPOCK: Is there nothing you can do?
I trust you can explain why it was necessary?
The traveller is returning.
I sent the others up to the ship. What happened?
One small thing was changed this time. A pet died.
Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up.
Stand by to reverse course.
Captain, that's the source of the radio emissions.
Captain, we're still gaining speed.
No good, sir. We're still falling toward it.
How much time do we have?
Captain, there's another signal. Listen.
Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu. Maintain orbit.
Slingshot effect, Mister Spock? Do we have enough power?
I'll need some time for the computations, Captain.
It's coming from that ship, Captain.
You're sure, Mister Spock?
Mister Spock, any indication of that ship's power source?
A lighter and stronger material than anything we have now.
Look, every pod, they've all been burst open.
Aye, from the inside, from the looks of them.
Must have been some accident to get almost every pod.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Negative, Captain. It stopped transmitting when you beamed aboard.
What do you make of it, Spock?
Gives me the creeps. I feel like something's watching us.
I feel it too, Captain.
Enterprise, do you read me? Sulu?
We can cut our way out of here.
You mean we're trapped here? No communication, nothing?
Something to shield this room. But shield it from what?
Possibly from whatever had come aboard their ship.
Quite right, Mister Scott. No known form of life.
Will it hold?
What is it?
I'm not sure, but I think
A message from three hundred million years ago?
I may be able to get a translation.
Get out of here! Hurry!
Piece of cake, sir. Here they come now.
Captain, something's beamed aboard with you.
Transport it back out.
Sickbay reports no injuries to crew, sir.
No damage to hull or engines, Captain.
Like the beating of a heart.
Bridge to Sickbay.
Something's jammed the circuits. They're magnetised.
I thank you, sir.
Phaser banks were off, Captain. They activated themselves.
And mutual override did not work?
Sir, we cannot get into the core.
Drained of all energy, sir.
It would have a very small field.
It's activated, Captain, but only an area three metres square.
Do you get a magnetic flux reading there now?
It has absorbed the memory banks, Captain, all of them.
All nonessential systems are extinguished. You will obey me.
Stop! You'll hurt him.
I'll obey. Let him go.
I'm all right, Captain.
What are we dealing with, Spock?
That's the heart of the galaxy, Captain.
I'm aware of that, Mister Spock.
Auxiliary controls ready to activate, Captain.
The auxiliary warp drive controls can only be operated manually.
That is correct. You will activate the manual controls. Obey!
Standby to activate warp drive unit.
Is it gone?
Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector.
The Intrepid is manned by Vulcans, isn't it?
Yes, that's right, Bones.
What is it, Spock? Are you in pain?
Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay.
Get to the Sickbay.
No, no, no. That's an order.
It is dead.
I sensed it die.
Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die.
It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody.
I cannot filter out the distortion, sir. It's getting worse.
Slow to warp three.
Exactly what are we looking for, Mister Spock?
I would assume that.
What is that?
Hold present course. Slow to warp one.
Aye, sir. Probe ready. Switching data feed to library computer.
What was that?
The telemetry probe, sir. There's no signal from it.
I have none, Captain. Insufficient data.
I'm just dizzy. I'll be all right. I'm fine, sir.
Kirk here. What is it?
Not unless she's feeling ill. I've got an emergency here.
I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet.
Good. Kirk out. Hold our position, Mister Kyle.
Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead.
No analysis due to insufficient information.
So far that's not much help.
I'm all right. Distance from zone of darkness, Mister Kyle?
Transmission to Starfleet complete, sir.
Penetration of the zone in one minute, seven seconds, sir.
It's not coming from communications, sir.
Captain, the stars are gone!
Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars.
Kirk to McCoy.
I am asking how, mister. I want answers. Kirk out.
Bones, how bad is it?
Two thirds of the personnel are affected.
Why? How? Do you have any answers?
Between where we were and where we are.
Are you trying to be funny, Mister Spock?
It would never occur to me, Captain.
Do you have any ideas, Spock?
Sickbay to Captain Kirk.
Jim, according to the life indicators, the energy levels
According to the life monitors, we're dying.
Are you all right?
What was that?
He just gave us reverse power. We lurched forward.
Doctor. Life function indicators. They've started a sharp drop again.
What do you think, Scotty? Forward thrust?
Doctor, they seem to be stabilising.
What was it you sensed?
The touch of death.
And what do you think they felt?
That ought to do it. Engineering to Captain Kirk.
Kirk here. What is it, Scotty?
Ready to try it when you are, sir.
Do we have the power to pull it off, Scotty?
Prepare to launch a probe, Mister Chekov.
Aye, sir. Probe ready for launch, sir.
Probe will impact in seven point three seconds.
Are we still in contact with the probe?
Yes, sir. Data being relayed to Mister Spock.
That is an amoeba.
We could send one man in, pinpoint its vulnerable spots.
It's a suicide mission.
The Vulcans saw it first and died.
Just because the Vulcans failed
I am more capable.
Gentlemen, I am not taking volunteers.
You don't think you're going?
I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are.
Gentlemen, I'll decide.
Engineering to Captain Kirk.
Very well. Prepare the shuttlecraft for launching.
Right. I'll get a few things I need, Jim.
Then employ one of your own superstitions. Wish me luck.
All systems clear for shuttlecraft launch. sir.
Lieutenant Uhura, channel automatic telemetry directly to the computers.
Power drain is enormous and growing worse.
You want to bet?
Spock, save your power for the shields.
Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven minutes.
You mean there'll be two of those things?
Spock, do you read me? Spock, do you read me?
Captain, I'm getting telemetry.
Mister Chekov, telemetry analysis as it comes in.
How much time do we have?
Put it on, Lieutenant.
How do you feel?
What's on your mind?
Scotty, how much power do we have left?
Exactly. Prepare to divert power on my signal. Kirk out.
Have you got something to say?
We're through, sir.
I believe everybody is aware of that, Mister Chekov.
Captain, we've only twenty six percent power reserves after entry.
Do we have impulse power, Scotty?
We are committed.
That thing would probably like phasers. It eats power.
We can't use the power to destroy it.
Aye, it couldn't swallow that.
It's on its way, sir.
Helmsman, when do you estimate arrival at nucleus?
How close are you going to it?
Point blank range. We'll implant it then back away.
Why? The probe has a range of
Programming complete. Ready for launch.
Despite what Spock said, it's still plenty sensitive.
Estimate we'll be out in six point thirty seven minutes.
Lieutenant, get me Spock's voice channel. Highest possible gain.
Do not risk the ship further on my behalf.
Shut up, Spock! We're rescuing you.
Almost out. We're approaching the membrane, sir.
You may have just written our epitaph, Mister Scott.
I don't know how, sir, but it's still with us.
Spock, you're alive!
Don't be so smart, Spock. You botched the acetylcholine test.
Spock, McCoy, we're beaming down. Standard equipment.
The beginnings of industrialisation.
So we're going down to recontaminate them.
Let's not argue about it. Let's go study it. Energise.
This is like coming home.
Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please?
That's a weapon. Be careful with that.
Well, those firearms are not necessary.
You trying to make trouble?
Don't give me those baby blue eyes.
I don't go for that innocent routine.
I never heard such stupid questions in my life.
Krako's getting more gall all the time .
Is this how you greet all your guests?
Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask.
Ask the boss. I don't know nothing. Get moving.
This is the contamination you're looking for, Jim.
No, thank you. You're Mister Oxmyx.
That's me, pal.
This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy.
Yes. Judging from what we've seen so far, I agree.
You're the government here?
But there are other bosses, other territories?
How do you know about Krako?
He hit us, Boss.
I'll take care of it.
Hey, wait a minute. That's the Book.
I know it's a book.
The Book. They left it, the other ship. The Horizon.
You said they were imitative, and the book
I don't want any more cracks about the Book.
Did they leave any other books?
What is it you want?
Mister Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit. Under no circum
Let's see how this thing works.
Out of the question.
Hold it. It's a communication device.
How does it work?
It's locked onto my ship's systems.
It's the Bible.
Yeah, well, Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all.
Oh, yes, yes. I wouldn't waste my time.
Yes. The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays.
If it were dark on Tuesday.
I have never computed them, Captain.
I'll get it.
Surely, you're coming, Captain.
I will, but I'm bringing Bela Oxmyx with me.
Jim, you can't
Hold it! Okay, pally, we're going for a ride.
If you don't mind, I'd rather walk.
I'm beginning to get the idea.
Mister Spock, what are you doing on this frequency?
So you're the Fed, huh? Well, well, well, well, well.
You want to make a deal.
That's right, a deal. I want you to help me.
I'm sorry, Krako. No deal.
That's too bad. Put him on ice!
You mean you're giving up?
Mister Spock, Mister Oxmyx is making contact from the surface.
On audio, Lieutenant. Mister Oxmyx, this is Mister Spock.
Irrelevant, since we are here.
Why would he put a bag on our captain?
You'll show no further hostility?
I'm a businessman, pally. What do ya say?
Since we must have our captain back, I accept.
You mean you're going to trust him?
Now you're beginning to make sense.
You know what to do.
Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce.
I was hoping you'd think that, dummy.
We're trying to help you, Oxmyx.
Sir, you are employing a double negative.
Yeah, but I got to be the unity.
We did, Captain. The situation required our return.
To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor.
Then you don't mind if I play a hunch?
What are we going to do now, Jim?
It ought to be. It cost a bundle.
A fliwer, Captain.
It was that bad?
They don't look like the trusting type.
I beg your pardon?
You're going to hit somebody. Can I watch?
Where'd you get them ears?
Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous.
Hold on, Spock. Out of the mouths of babes
Who you callin' a babe?
I'm calling you a babe.
What's in it for me?
What do you want?
A piece of the action.
You'll know what to do.
That's it. Let's go.
What's the matter? Did you hurt yourself, kid?
I want my daddy!
Daddy! I want my daddy!
I want my daddy.
A piece of the action.
No one can see. Put your phaser on stun.
I think you've got it reversed, Mister Krako.
I ain't, pally. Put down your heaters.
Mister Krako, I don't, er
Can you trust all your men?
A miniscule. A very small piece.
How much is that?
That's, er. We'll figure it out later.
I thought you guys had laws. No interference.
Who's interfering? We're taking over. Check?
What's your cut?
Kirk to Enterprise.
All right, Scotty. We made a deal with Krako.
Do you think that's wise, sir?
Aye. I know indeed.
I got rights.
It's faster than walking.
But not as safe.
Are you afraid of cars?
Not at all, Captain. It's your driving that alarms me.
Spock, I've got the hang of it. Now go on.
Where are they?
Knowing Krako, he'll probably send them back on a blotter.
Kirk to Enterprise.
You got Krako on ice?
Find the man at the other end of the phone
I sure don't know what you think you're talking about.
Get with it. I'm giving the orders here.
I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx.
And what's your percentage?
Listen. They got a ship. I know. I was there.
What, a couple of boys?
I'm not going to believe my eyes.
There are over four hundred guys there.
That's your story, buster.
My boys will put you down.
I already seen it. You're nothing, Fed.
Well, all right. Go ahead. Don't get smart.
Hello, Scotty. This is Kirk.
Gee, that's some trick.
Hey, did you see that?
He was talking about a percentage.
I was talking about both.
It's reasonable. It sounds reasonable. That sound reasonable to you?
But in all the confusion I
I think I left it in Bela's office.
Somewhere. I'm not certain.
You're not certain of what?
I left my communicator.
You really think it's that serious?
How do you mean?
Lieutenant Uhura, let's go.
It must be a transporter malfunction.
That was a rough trip.
This is the craziest landing pad I've ever seen.
That's a trinary sun.
Scott to Bridge.
Have you reversed controls?
Either of you hurt?
I don't think so, Captain.
There, Captain. Now you are prepared for your training.
How do you know our names?
The Providers were expecting you, Captain. They arranged your transportation.
These Providers of yours, are they
Correction, Captain. The Providers are not ours. We are theirs.
What do they want from us?
No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors.
Where are they then?
These are your quarters. Open, thralls.
They are not within the confines of this solar system.
The odds are not good.
No. I would say approximately four hundred
I am your drill thrall. I am called Lars.
What do you want from her?
It is not allowed to refuse selection.
Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.
What would account for that, Spock?
You, you have been selected for me?
That's very kind of you, miss, but
It is nourishment. We call it that.
Nourishment. That's very practical. What do you call this collar?
It is only to warn and punish.
How does he work it?
It is not permitted to talk of that.
Will you provide all my nourishment?
What does that mean?
It means you're a very beautiful woman.
What is beautiful?
Born? I have been here always.
Your parents. Where are they? Your mother and father.
She who bore me was killed in a freestyle match.
You will learn all these things.
This is ridiculous. There's nothing out there. Nothing at all.
We certainly seem to be heading into an empty sector.
That must be two dozen light years away.
It is not allowed to refuse a training exercise.
None of us will do it, Galt.
It is part of your training. The Providers wish it.
The devil with the Providers.
He's pretty fast with that whip.
We're free people. We belong to no one.
It's always possible to miss something.
Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism?
No, sir. There was no sign of failure.
That is the way.
Their voices sound mechanical. Are they computers?
You've seen them. Do they have bodies?
Not such as ours.
What is this place?
It is not used.
They do have bodies, or did have.
One does not talk of such things.
Very pretty country. Very much like my home planet, Earth.
I have looked at them.
How can one live on a flicker of light?
Dark? But all is lighted. Here, the chambers.
What else would one do?
What is love?
I do not think your words are allowed.
And this. Is this also helping?
You could call it that.
Doctor McCoy speaks for me, too, sir.
Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven?
You're disturbed about what happened today.
This is going to kill our romance.
Welcome to Triskelion, gentlemen.
What the voice said was true, sir. Nothing is functioning.
But you are afraid.
It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect.
Not for true gamesters.
Three against one? Those are pretty high odds.
Your, your terms are unfair.
Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms.
Yes, that's clear.
What in the name of heaven is this?
Heaven's got very little to do with this.
You lied. Everything you said.
The thralls will be trained?
I understand, a little. You will leave us now?
To go back to the lights in the sky?
Then teach me how, and I will follow you.
One parsec, sir. Close enough to smell them.
I was making a little joke, sir.
Mister Spock, immediate past history of the quadrant?
Analysis of disputed area?
Burke, sir? I don't think so. I'm sure it was
Oh, Royal Academy. Well
Go to warp factor six.
Code One emergency. That's a disaster call.
But there's nothing there. Just the station.
That was my order, Captain.
This is my assistant Arne Darvin.
And this is my first officer Mister Spock.
Mister Spock, you've made your point.
Of course, Captain, I realise that
What do you mean?
Misuse of the Priority One channels is a Federation offence.
Kirk to Enterprise.
I guess not.
I see you didn't waste time taking your shore leave.
Does everybody know about this wheat but me?
Not everyone, Captain. It's a Russian invention.
I use that to polish the flame gems.
Not at your price.
What is it? Is it alive? May I hold it?
Oh, it's adorable. What is it?
What is it? Why, lovely lady, it's a tribble.
Oh, it's purring. Listen, it's purring.
It's only saying that it likes you.
Are you selling them?
That's what we're trying to decide right now.
He won't bite, will he?
Twice nothing is still nothing.
That's my offer.
That's a joke.
Done. When can I have them?
All right, what are you selling them for?
In fact, I'll sell you this one.
Hey! He's eating my grain.
Oh, I couldn't. Could I?
What are you trying to do, ruin the market?
Yes, what is it?
Put it on visual, Lieutenant.
Now, that's just lovely.
Yes, Lieutenant, what is it?
What is the position of the Klingon ship?
Captain, I have Mister Lurry.
Cancel Red Alert. We'll beam right down.
Let us both take steps to keep it that way.
Don't you ever relax?
I am relaxing.
How long have you had that thing, Lieutenant?
Well, in that case, you got a bargain.
Did you get this at the space station?
Pipe it down here will you, Mister Chekov.
Yes, Mister Baris. What can I do for you?
Kirk, this station is swarming with Klingons.
Captain, may I ask where you'll be?
Sickbay with a headache.
Bones, what have you got for a headache?
Let me guess. Klingons? Baris?
Both. How many of these did Uhura give you?
But you've got, er, eleven.
How do they? How do they?
A fat tribble.
No. You get a bunch of hungry little tribbles.
I'll tell them before they go, sir.
Aren't you going on shore leave, Scotty?
Ah, friend. Can I offer you a charming little tribble?
Oh. Perhaps one of you other gents?
Get it away from me.
Get out of here with that parasite.
He's only a harmless little
This is vodka.
It was invented by a little old lady from Leningrad.
The Earthers like those fuzzy things, don't they?
Easy, lad. You ought to be more forgiving.
Take it easy, lad. Everybody's entitled to an opinion.
Don't do it, mister, and that's an order.
Laddie, don't you think you should rephrase that?
I don't know, sir.
No, sir, I didn't.
I don't know, sir.
They insulted us, sir.
Must have been some insult.
You held? Why did Chekov want to start a fight?
Well, the Klingon, sir. Is this off the record?
No, this is not off the record.
And then they said you
I get the picture, Scotty.
No, I didn't. You told us to avoid trouble.
What was it they said that started the fight?
I see. And that's when you hit the Klingons?
Well, sir, this was a matter of pride.
There's something disquieting about these creatures.
Don't tell me you've got a feeling.
What is that, Doctor?
I like them better than I like you.
They do have one redeeming characteristic.
I know, but really
Of course. What did you say?
That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring?
Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent?
I heard you.
He simply could not believe his ears.
What evidence do you have against Mister Jones?
Yes, yes. Go on. What else do you have?
But he is after my grain!
Do you have any proof of that?
You can't deny he's disrupted this station.
Probably through one of the air vents.
Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened.
Yes, sir. Nothing could get in.
It's not working, sir. It seems to be stuck.
Here. Let me try it.
They seem to be gorged.
Hundreds of thousands.
That's assuming they got here three days ago.
Now he tells me.
Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these.
Really, Captain Kirk, I must protest this treatment.
Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful. A few questions.
What do you want?
Can you get those things out of here?
What was in the bar?
Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain.
Oh, yes. It was poisoned.
That is essentially it.
Mister Darvin, are you going to talk?
And the tribbles had nothing to do with it?
You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles.
Well, Captain, I suppose I'm free to go now.
The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony.
There is one thing you can do.
It would take years.
Consider it Job security.
Captain, you're a hard man. All right! All right!
You'll do it?
He'll do it.
I'll do it.
Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that freighter.
And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship.
Bones, how did you do it?
Scotty! Where are the tribbles?
Oh, er, Captain, it was really Mister Spock's recommendation.
Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering.
Mister Scott. Where are the tribbles?
Where are they?
I gave them to the Klingons, sir.
Captain, I think I'm going to like Argelius.
Obviously a man of good taste.
Do you like her, Scotty?
Aye. Why shouldn't I?
Scotty, Scotty. In Argelius they use the lights.
Have one of our pillows?
Never a word, but I'm dying to learn.
Or a handsome gentleman. Why don't we?
Physically he's all right. Am I right in assuming that?
He seems he's overcoming his resentment.
Oh yes. I know the place. Let's go.
She's dead, Jim.
Stabbed, a dozen times.
We're just as shocked as you are, Mister Hengist.
You're not a native of Argelius, sir?
I, I don't remember.
Really, sir. That is hardly helpful.
Scotty, you've got to remember.
You don't think by any chance that Scotty
It doesn't make any difference what I think.
But you don't just throw him to the wolves.
But he's suffering from a severe concussion.
We'll do what we can.
The law of Argelius is love.
And this is my wife, Sybo.
You know of this?
Kirk to Enterprise.
Lieutenant Karen Tracy reporting as ordered, Captain.
If you'll Just follow me, Lieutenant.
Of course, there's another possibility.
Are you ready, Sybo?
I am ready. May I have the knife, please?
But I put it here when we arrived. It's gone.
She's dead, Jim. Just like the other one.
Stabbed over and over again.
Lieutenant? Captain? Where's
Dead? But I
It could be, Jim. That head injury.
Locks can be picked, Jim.
Where've they been during the past few minutes?
Captain, if you don't mind please.
There's been another murder, Hengist. One of my crew.
The same as Kara.
Please, I know nothing about it. I didn't kill anyone.
Well, how was the girl killed?
Stabbed. And there's no sign of the weapon.
If only I had facilities.
Is this true? Who are you?
Did you know Kara?
That is very disquieting.
Jealousy has often been a motive for murder.
Prefect, I didn't kill anyone. I couldn't.
We shall see, Morla.
Can you prove you went directly home?
Captain, may I continue with the questions please?
Well get on with it, man. Just don't stand there.
I am ready, Jaris.
What do you suggest, Mister Spock?
Normally, no, but that blow on his head could
That is unproven, sir.
We can prove it, if he's insane.
Gentlemen, please. How could any man do such monstrous things?
That's what we hope to find out, sir.
You, sir, claim to remember nothing about the murders.
No doubt will remain.
Mister Scott, will you take the stand?
Sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional amnesia?
Captain, I don't see how that can be.
Unless Scotty's lying about his loss of memory.
All right, Scotty, let's have it.
No, Captain. That I'm sure of.
Scotty, lie to me. How old are you?
There were two other women murdered.
Mister Scott. Did you kill Kara?
I don't remember.
Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?
I don't remember.
This is a waste of time.
I object to the entire procedure.
Prefect, I know you mean well, but I've had experience
Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered?
I'm not sure. Walking home, I assume. I was angry.
Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?
Did you kill Sybo?
Sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact, Captain.
She said something else, words that didn't make sense.
Computer, linguistic bank. Definition of following word. Redjac.
There is no such word in the linguistics bank?
Working. Affirmative. A proper name.
That's ridiculous. He lived hundreds of years ago.
A man couldn't survive all these centuries.
Sybo said it feeds on death.
Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity.
Affirmative. Precedent, mellitus, cloud creature of Alpha Majoris One.
Doesn't seem likely, does it?
Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth.
You come from Rigel Four.
Well, many people do. It's not a crime.
I will not.
And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered.
Computer. Report on analysis of Exhibit A.
Specify. Point of origin.
Now then, Mister Hengist
He's dead, Jim.
But that's impossible.
It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked.
That should prove very interesting.
We're turning back. Warp five, Helm.
Warp five, sir. On course for Capella Four.
The Carolina is registered in this sector.
Ignore it, Lieutenant. Log it as my order, my responsibility.
Scotty, if it should turn out to be real
My patient spattered me with a rock. She's gone.
I'll go with you.
Estimating to planet?
Drawing a line, daring us to step over it.
Still closing. The alien's directly in our line of flight.
Phaser banks are ready, sir.
The Earthmen make excellent game. Their cleverness has surprised me.
Dead. I killed them as they slept.
If true, take us to them.
First, we'll verify her story.
Is this what your sworn word means, Klingon?
There's just one thing I want.
One of us must get him.
Hold it there. Drop your weapons.
We missed you, Mister Scott.
Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting.
We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott.
Nor does Doctor McCoy.
The child was named Leonard James Akaar?
How does that Vulcan salute go?
Vulcan honours us with your presence. We come to serve.
Doctor. My aides and she who is my wife.
I'd prefer another guide, Captain.
Captain, Ambassador Sarek and his wife are my parents.
Humans smile with so little provocation.
The situation between my father and myself has not changed.
Mister Spock. A moment, if you please.
Mrs. Sarek, I just don't understand.
Amanda. I'm afraid you couldn't pronounce the Vulcan name.
It sounded more like a command.
Of course. He's a Vulcan. I'm his wife.
And Spock is his son.
Spock is my best officer, and my friend.
They are both stubborn.
A human trait, Captain?
No! You! How do you vote, Sarek of Vulcan?
Tellarites do not argue for reasons. They simply argue.
You are correct, Captain. Quite logical.
Have you met Gav before, Ambassador?
We debated during my last council session. Ambassador.
It's sort of a fat teddy bear.
A teddy bear?
A teddy bear.
Does she answer a hail?
Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours.
Care to guess what she is?
Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate.
He's also human.
He's a Starfleet officer.
I thought you didn't approve of Starfleet.
Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten.
Vulcan, I would speak to you.
It does seem unavoidable.
How do you vote on the Coridan admission?
That's well for you. Vulcan has no mining interest.
Some of your ships have been carrying Coridan dilithium crystals.
Understood. There will be payment for your slander, Sarek.
Threats are illogical. And payment is usually expensive.
Security to Captain Kirk.
How was he killed?
His neck was broken. By an expert.
Who aboard would have that knowledge?
Vulcans do not approve of violence.
You're saying he couldn't have done it?
You want something of me, Captain?
Ambassador, the Tellarite. Gav has been murdered.
Yes. Ambassador, where were you during the past hour?
Captain, you're not accusing him?
I quite agree.
Then where were you during the hour?
That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador.
Can you help him?
I don't know that yet either.
I'm sorry about your father.
Yes, it could adversely affect our mission.
Aren't you worried about him?
I think it unlikely it is one of theirs.
It's the intruder ship, sir.
Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant.
Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission.
Bones, how is he?
Why didn't you tell me?
There was nothing you could have done.
Ambassador, when did you have these attacks?
There were no witnesses?
Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect?
Because of the construction of the Vulcan heart.
There are other Vulcans aboard.
Yes, I'd say that's rare.
It should be possible to filter out the human factors.
Indeed. I would estimate the odds
I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian.
Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan.
Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental.
But it does look promising.
What drug, Doctor? My husband is asleep. What drug?
Already pulled. You're perfectly healthy, Mister Spock.
What has that got
It would seem the only answer.
I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner.
You can turn command over to Scotty.
Spock, you must turn command over to somebody else.
Duty? Your duty is to your father.
Nothing is as important as your father's life.
Oh, go to him. Now. Please.
No, the one inside my head. How long have I
Not good. If I could only operate.
What's stopping you? I thought you were all ready.
Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again.
Captain, are you quite all right?
Get out, Spock. Chekov, what's the status of the intruder?
Call Mister Scott to the bridge.
Captain, the alien vessel is moving closer.
Belay that order. I'll stay here.
Security? Security to the brig. Search the prisoner immediately.
Where do you think you're going?
I must see the captain.
So is your father's life.
Moving away. Turning now. He's coming around again.
Fire as he passes, Ensign.
A clean miss, sir.
Report on his weaponry, Mister Chekov.
He's coming around again.
Full spread missed, sir. They're moving too fast for us.
The systems are off.
Call engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority.
Number four shield has buckled, sir.
That was intended from the beginning, Captain.
You're not Andorian. Who are you?
Number two shield is gone.
Find your own answers, Captain. You haven't long to live.
What are you doing?
No. Stand by your phasers, Mister Chekov.
Looking us over. We're dead as far as he knows.
You're baiting him. You're trying to lure him in.
Here he comes. Range decreasing. Speed dropping close to sublight.
Hold your fire, Mister Chekov.
Take him to Sickbay.
I seem to have miscalculated.
Are you quite through shaking the ship around?
Spock, Sarek how are they?
Some doctors have all the luck.
Captain, I believe you'll find the alien
I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor.
But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet?
You might have had something else on your mind.
No, but thank you anyway.
I don't understand.
For saving your life.
Emotional, isn't she?
She has always been that way.
Indeed? Why did you marry her?
At the time, it seemed the logical thing to do.
Doctor, I'll return to my station now.
You are at your station, Mister Spock.
Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this.
Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy.
How is she, Doc?
Small thanks to the Starfleet.
Now really, Commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet.
I should've received the proper inoculations ahead of time.
Will you check your automatic scanner, please?
That's odd. I've never seen anything like that before.
Nor have I.
Staying right with us. Sensor readings, Mister Spock.
We've got it.
Helm does not answer, Captain.
What's happening? I demand to know.
I insist you make your scheduled rendezvous with the Enterprise.
Just how long am I supposed to stay inside, Captain?
There must be a reason.
Let's look a little further.
Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is.
We're real enough.
You're a Vulcan, aren't you?
He's human, Jim. Everything checks out perfectly.
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.
You don't mind if we continue to try?
Go right ahead. You've got plenty of time.
What about you, Cochrane? How did you get here?
How perceptive of you to notice I needed one.
Talks a lot, but he doesn't say much.
I've noticed something else.
He looks familiar.
Familiar? Now that you mention it, he does.
I can't quite place him, but. What about Miss Hedford?
Must you keep it so terribly hot in here?
Do you feel hot?
I feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged.
I'll rest later, Doctor.
Yes, I know. It means we're running out of time.
What was that?
There's nothing to explain.
All right. It was the Companion.
You were injured?
I was dying, Mister Spock.
You seem perfectly all right now. What was the matter?
I was an old man.
You were what?
That's a pretty far out story.
Mister Cochrane, do you have a first name?
That's right, Captain.
Isn't your story a little improbable, Mister Cochrane?
True, his body was never found.
You're looking at it, Mister Spock.
How do you feel?
Terrible. How should I feel?
You're running a little temperature. Perhaps you should lie down.
How long do we have?
A matter of hours, that's all.
I haven't aged. The Companion sees to that.
I already know.
You wouldn't mind telling us?
You won't like it.
I already don't like it.
You're here to keep me company.
You mean you brought us here?
I'd begin to age again, normally.
Do you want to leave here?
You've got it.
I said it was very powerful.
Could it cure her?
I don't know.
How do you communicate with it?
How do you do it?
I just sort of clear my mind and it comes.
Bones, what do you make of that?
Almost a symbiosis of some kind, a sort of joining.
No, it's more than that.
Agreed. More like love.
Are you all right?
The Companion can't do anything to help Miss Hedford.
Then she'll die.
Spock! Are you all right?
It attacked you?
It troubles you, Cochrane?
It's also keeping you prisoner.
I don't want it killed.
We may simply render it powerless.
I suppose from your point of view, you're right.
All right. You want me to contact it?
Nor it ours.
What kind of talk is that?
It isn't your fault.
The translator is for use with more congruent life forms.
There'd still be traces of residual matter floating around, Lieutenant.
Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu.
What do you think it means, Mister Scott?
We stay on this course, see what comes up.
It's a big galaxy, Mister Scott.
What's the theory behind this device?
Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation.
I'm way ahead of you.
Then it is not a zookeeper.
But I heard
I don't understand.
I'm a what?
What are you complaining about? It kept you alive.
That thing fed on me. It used me. It's disgusting.
You're as bad as it is.
Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude.
I heard him. He was loved and he resents it.
Companion, do you love the man?
I do not understand.
He is part of me. The man must continue.
He does not age. He remains forever.
I do not understand.
What did you hope to gain by that, Jim?
It's useless. I know.
That'll take some explaining, Bones.
Too late. All of this, just an illusion.
No illusion. Jackson is dead. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
Five to beam up.
Can you pinpoint it any closer, Lieutenant?
Sir, I'm picking up a ship's disaster beacon.
Try to raise it, Lieutenant.
No answer, Captain. All I get is the automatic beacon.
Sensors not recording normal energy output.
It's the Constellation. Look at that.
Red alert. Red alert. Man your battle stations.
We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command.
Filtration systems are out, sir.
What do you think did it, sir?
The crew wasn't abducted, they just left. Kirk to Enterprise.
We'll continue our search. Kirk out.
Exhausted. They didn't give up without a battle.
Matt. Matt, it's Jim Kirk.
Kirk. It's Jim Kirk.
What happened to your ship, Matt?
A ship. Attacked. That, that thing.
What thing? What was it?
Answer me! What was it? What happened, Matt?
Ready with the duplicate log, sir.
What happened to your crew?
Matt, where's your crew?
There is no third planet.
Captain, Washburn has our report.
What does it look like?
Both or neither. I don't know.
Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to heavy subspace interference.
A robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. Why?
We don't know. An alien race, apparently from another galaxy.
Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine?
No. I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.
Oh, no, I stay here. I'm not leaving my ship!
It's closing on us, Mister Spock.
Ready to beam, sir.
Mister Spock, communication's damaged. We're unable to override interference.
I can't repair warp drive without a spacedock.
No casualties, Mister Spock. How are we doing?
We have outrun it, Doctor.
You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu.
That thing must be destroyed.
You can't let him do this, Spock.
Doctor, you are out of line.
I'll certify that right now.
Then your statement would not be considered valid.
What about the Captain? We can't leave
Captain, the impulse engines' control circuits are fused solid.
Helmsman, hold your course. Stand by all phaser banks.
Ready to give it a try?
Scotty, how you doing?
Try it now, Captain.
Washburn, get down to Engineering. Assist Mister Scott.
But don't you understand? We've got to destroy it!
We can't break loose!
We haven't got it. We're being pulled inside.
Scotty, give me that power.
That's it, Mister Scott. Keep that power coming.
Aye, sir. We still can't move.
Keep pouring it on, Scotty.
Captain, I still don't know what we're doing.
Phasers? You've got 'em. I have one bank recharged.
We're loose, Commodore.
It's closing fast on the Constellation.
Commodore, I suggest
We're moving away, Commodore.
It's closing with us again, sir.
Mister Spock, we've pierced the interference locally.
Can you raise Starfleet?
Matt. What's going on? Give me Mister Spock.
I'm in command here, Jim.
Nothing. I assumed command according to regulations
You are speaking to a senior officer, Kirk.
Give me Spock.
How long to repair warp drive?
It's gaining on us, sir.
Mister Spock, relieve Commodore Decker immediately. That's a direct order.
Commodore Decker, you are relieved of command.
I don't recognise your authority to relieve me.
Captain, I have assumed command.
You will accompany the commodore to Sickbay.
Fine. Just make sure you stay ahead of it.
Keep it going, Scotty, keep it going. Mister Spock.
It's too late, sir.
Kirk to Enterprise. Why are you launching a shuttlecraft?
Enterprise to shuttlecraft. Come in, shuttlecraft.
Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Decker here.
Commodore, I must insist that you return to the ship.
This is Kirk. Matt, you'll be killed.
We're stronger with you than without you!
He's gone. Constellation, come in, please.
It's regrettable that he died for nothing.
Mister Spock, the transporter is now operational.
Transporter operational, Captain. Shall we beam you aboard?
There's little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation.
Insufficient data. I shall try to take further sensor readings.
Spock, you don't know?
Captain, you're getting dangerously close to the planet killer.
Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker.
A calculated risk, Mister Spock.
Thirty seconds is very slim timing.
A chance I'll have to take. Kirk out.
Understood. Mister Spock. Prepare to beam Scotty on board.
What's the matter with that thing?
It's a power drain somewhere, sir. I almost lost you.
Transporter is out, Captain. You'll have to stand by.
I can't. Power level's dropping too fast. You'd better hurry.
Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal.
Beam me aboard.
Energising. Bridge, it's shorted out again.
Och, what's wrong with it?
Gentlemen, beam me aboard.
Mister Scott, twenty seconds to detonation.
Sixty, fifty, forty
Gentlemen, I suggest you beam me aboard.
Try her now, Mister Kyle.
Bridge, we got him through!
Start your readings.
It is spectacular, isn't it?
It's a shame to have to intrude.
Are you sure about that?
It makes me homesick. Just like Russia.
More like the Garden of Eden, Ensign.
What did somebody say? That paradise must've looked like this?
Aye, Captain. It's a shame about Hendorff.
What is it?
But you say there's nothing to worry about?
Well, sir, I didn't exactly say that.
I hear it's nice down there.
Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions.
What is it?
What is it, Mister Spock?
I was about to take some readings.
Whatever it is, it moves like a cat.
Jim, I don't like this.
Garden of Eden, with land mines.
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
I couldn't stop it, but I know why.
We're heading there now, Scotty. You need any help?
There's nothing you can do about it, sir.
Some kind of generator?
Peculiar stuff to find in paradise.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Spock. Are you all right?
Just what do you think you were trying to do?
I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I
I shall do so.
One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred
Thirty seconds ago, there wasn't a cloud in the sky.
It's over there! That way! I never saw anything like
Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this.
His father helped me get into the Academy.
Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable.
I could've prevented all of it.
I don't see how.
Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient!
What do you want, violence?
I am the eyes of Vaal. He must see.
Who is Vaal?
Vaal is Vaal. He is everything.
Do you have a name?
Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir?
You speak of the people of Vaal. Are they nearby?
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
Aye, sir. All we have is impulse power.
Put it on maximum. Full emergency circuits.
They're all on, Captain.
No, sir. We're slipping.
I'll do everything there is to do, sir. Scott out.
Tell me about Vaal.
Take me to him. I wish to speak to him.
I'll take my chances.
But this is not the centre, Mister Spock.
A force field?
Akuta, how do you talk to Vaal?
When does he get hungry?
These are the people of Vaal.
Where are the others?
There are no others.
Children? You use unknown words to me.
Little ones like yourselves. They grow.
Replacements. None are necessary. They are forbidden by Vaal.
Love. Strange words. Children. Love. What is love?
Love is when two people are
Ah, yes. The holding, the touching. Vaal has forbidden this.
Welcome to Vaal.
Well, thank you. It does something for you.
Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable.
I am Sayana. You have a name?
Yes. Spock. I am Spock.
I fail to see what they find so amusing.
Nothing makes sense down here. Kirk to Enterprise.
Sir, we're doing everything within engineering reason.
That's not the way.
In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity.
Did it maintain, Scotty?
That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty.
Yeoman, you're wasting energy.
Captain, we're trapped,
Sit down, and have something to eat.
The Enterprise is up there
They'd need a replacement. Opinion, Mister Spock?
From a machine? That I'd like to see.
I understand, Vaal. It shall be done.
Any place we can be together is paradise.
I don't know.
Will we be able to get back aboard?
No, not if you're with me.
Why do you look like that?
The way they touched. I do not understand.
It is pleasant, Makora.
Yes. They touched in this way.
Vaal! He is angry.
Kill, Akuta? We do not understand.
How's it going, Scotty?
I know that. As you said, that's cutting things fine.
Kirk out. What is it?
Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared.
Let's get out of here!
Second degree burns. Not serious, but I'll bet they smart.
Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement.
Captain, we're doing it. We're pulling away!
It's no good, sir. There's only a few systems responding.
You're fired. Four hundred people
Fine time to ring the dinner bell.
Scotty, do you still have phaser power?
Aye, but what
Aye, sir, but they won't penetrate that force field.
I would assume so.
Good. Let's see how long he can do it.
No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead.
Tractor beam gone. Potency returning to antimatter pods.
What are children?
I don't agree with you at all, Mister Spock.
That's not unusual, Doctor.
Jim, I want you to hear this.
Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis.
No, Mister Spock. I didn't think you would be.
Stand by to beam up landing party.
But we won't. Consider that. Enterprise. Transporter room, energise.
Spock was right. It was a rough trip.
Status of mission, Captain?
Carelessness with the equipment cannot be tolerated.
But Mister Spock, I
No, Mister Spock! I tried. I really tried.
Due to your error, Mister Kyle?
Captain, what is all this?
How did we get in these
I don't know. It's our Enterprise but it isn't. Maybe
When we first materialised.
Another Captain Kirk, another Doctor McCoy, another
An exchange. If we're here
What about the Halkans? We can't let them be destroyed.
Mister Chekov, phaser setting for planetary target A.
Still no interest, Uhura? Hmm? I could change your mind.
You are away from your post, Mister.
Do you have authorisation from security, sir?
I'll have to check with Security Chief Sulu, sir.
Never mind. I'll attend to it.
Shall I correct orbit to new firing position?
Lock on to secondary city.
Secondary target now moving beyond our phaser lock.
A serious breach of orders, Captain.
It is useless to resist us.
You have twelve hours to consider your position.
Twelve hours, Captain? That is unprecedented.
You're at liberty to do so, Mister Spock.
Yes, he did your job.
Smart boy, switching to the top dog.
Get him out of here.
All right. You're working for me.
You're in line. You might even make captain.
Not on my ship.
The booth for this one, sir?
Mister Sulu is Security Chief, like the ancient Gestapo.
Mostly variations in instrumentation. Nothing I can't handle.
Everything's exactly where it should be, except us.
Let's find out where we stand. Computer.
Record procedure. Scotty, can you do it?
I'm a doctor, not an engineer.
Let's find out. Computer.
Read out official record of current command.
Captain? We can do it.
On our Enterprise.
I can answer none of your questions at this time.
I haven't decided.
I said I haven't decided.
Spock, do you think we should destroy the Halkans?
Release Chekov. Confine him to quarters.
That ought to hold him for about six hours.
I was preoccupied.
Further than that, if I'm successful.
And if I don't?
I don't intend to kill him.
No, but I'll avoid killing Spock.
I'll get out of his way.
I hate this thing.
It's not that bad.
Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities
How does Marlena want to fit in?
We've got another deadline, too, sir.
A security research is in progress.
Who is conducting the research?
What is the nature of the research?
Programme is classified under voice index log.
Why are you monitoring my communications, Mister Sulu?
He's working on escape or defence.
That is my concern.
I still do.
I've got to go.
You don't have to do that.
You're the Captain's woman until he says you're not.
I was getting bored. Of course this isn't the time.
I'm afraid I changed my mind. Again.
You take a lot of chances, Lieutenant.
Mister Scott, all clear. On my way to Sickbay.
Now it's up to the captain.
Please restrict your movements, Captain.
Shoot. You're wasting time.
You're running a big risk, Spock.
How much time, Scotty?
We'll get home. This won't take long.
What is this, Mister Sulu?
Captain, we've barely got ten minutes.
Let's go, Bones.
I guarantee it. Now, go on, please.
It's working, sir.
But there are only three of you.
If you kill us, you'll still stay.
Where's McCoy? Time, Scotty.
Do you know what they'll do to me?
The power's cut, sir. They're on to us.
Aye, it's available.
Can you bridge to your setup?
One of us will have to stay.
I'll stay, Captain.
Get to the transporter chamber. You, too, Uhura.
That's an order, Scotty.
You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mister Spock.
The Empire shall be overthrown, of course.
You have one minute and twenty three seconds.
One man cannot summon the future.
The body is in Sickbay.
Show me Sickbay.
Doctor McCoy will show you.
I could have told you that without looking.
What are the lot of you staring at me for?
It's all right.
That thing did something to Lieutenant Uhura!
Scotty, she's being taken care of. It's all right.
What did it do to me?
Doctor McCoy will explain it to you.
Nurse, I want him prepared for a full physical examination.
You restored Scott. He had much more extensive damage.
Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere?
That's a laugh.
The study of it would be of great use, Captain.
Mister Spock is also one of your biological units, Creator?
Follow your instructions, Nomad.
My screens are down.
Sound it out.
How's she doing?
Get into direct mental contact with that thing?
You saw what it did to Uhura.
I will permit it, Creator.
What does it mean, we are Nomad?
Then it isn't Nomad?
I beg your pardon?
How are you doing that?
Throw your dampers.
Cut your circuits, all of them.
Impossible. It can't go that fast.
It just won't stop, Mister Scott. Warp eleven!
Nomad, stop what you're doing. Scotty?
Acknowledged. It is reversed as ordered, Creator.
Mister Scott, give Sulu warp two and keep her there.
You killed two of my
Creator, your biological units are inefficient.
I am programmed to investigate.
It was a foolish mistake.
I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities.
It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.
And it will carry out its prime directive. Sterilise.
Is she all right?
I think so. Looks like some kind of shock.
Manual override has been blocked. Source, Engineering.
Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in Engineering.
You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator.
I am perfect. I am Nomad.
But I am your creator.
You are the Creator.
I created you?
You are the Creator.
Answer unknown. I shall analyse.
You must sterilise in case of error?
Error is inconsistent with my prime functions. Sterilisation is correction.
Everything that is in error must be sterilised.
There are no exceptions.
The creation of perfection is no error.
I did not create perfection. I created error.
Your data is faulty. I am Nomad. I am perfect.
I am the Kirk, the creator?
You are the Creator.
You are flawed and imperfect! Execute your prime function!
Your logic was impeccable, Captain. We are in grave danger.
Nomad, you are imperfect!
Exercise your prime function.
My congratulations, Captain. A dazzling display of logic.
Lieutenant, you look a bit tired this morning.
Even from here I can tell his pulse rate's up.
I'm not sure I like that, Jim.
Actually, I'm losing an officer.
What is it, Mister Spock? Is it a hand?
A trick, then? A projection?
Not a projection, sir. A field of energy.
Hard about. We can't seem to get away from it.
It's almost as if it means to grab us.
We're dead still, Captain. Helm doesn't answer. We can't move.
Lieutenant, relay our position and circumstances to Starbase Twelve immediately.
Applying thrust, sir. No results, Captain. We're stuck tight.
Captain, a most curious development on scanner five seven.
Let's all take a look at it, Mister Spock.
Are you responsible for stopping the ship?
Give it back, then we'll talk.
All right! Whatever you're doing, turn it off! You win!
Pressure is gone, Captain. Space normal on hull.
Let's go, Bones. You in good voice?
Sure it's wise, Jim?
Verbose, isn't he?
Insults are effective only where emotion is present.
We're going to need help in all those areas.
You know of Earth? You've been there?
And I am the tsar of all the Russias.
I'm sorry, Captain. I never met a god before.
And you haven't yet. Readings, Doctor.
Evidently not so simple.
You will not leave this place.
I will not permit that device to work, either, Captain.
What is it you want?
You will worship me, as your fathers did before you.
I said you would worship me.
And you've got a lot to learn!
Try to break through it, Lieutenant.
Analysis. Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo?
Whatever he is, he seems to control a remarkable technology.
Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago
You have a theory?
I have an idea. What if he is really Apollo?
I mean your name.
Leave her alone.
And so do you.
I've grown weary of discussion and argument.
Captain, the phasers. All the working parts are fused.
Oh, it's beautiful.
She's not going with you.
It's all right, Captain. I'll go.
Without fear. She is fit indeed.
Bones, how is he?
He would have been rather difficult to stop.
Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation.
How do you feel, Scotty?
It would seem so.
I'm able, sir.
Scotty doesn't believe in gods.
Ready to reverse polarity, Mister Sulu?
Computed and standing by to generate, sir.
I'm working, sir, but I can't do anything with this.
I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir.
I can't seem to pinpoint it.
Oh, it's lovely.
You really think you're a god?
But you said the others didn't die.
I don't understand.
Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim.
That would seem most likely, sir.
Number one on our list of things to do.
Is that all you have to offer?
Bones, is it possible
Where's Lieutenant Palamas?
She is no longer of any concern to you.
You bloodthirsty Saracen, what have you done with her?
You will learn discipline. You will learn
Chekov, give me a hand.
Are you all right, Captain?
He disappeared again like the cat in that Russian story.
Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat?
Cheshire? No, sir. Minsk perhaps, but
How do you feel?
I can't get my arm to move.
We've got to get out of here.
I still say it can get us killed.
Speed is essential, Lieutenant.
Go! Gather laurel leaves? You must be joking!
Kill a deer. That's the funniest thing I ever heard.
You shall reap the rewards of your insolence!
We're tired of your phony fireworks!
Mortal, you have earned this!
How can they worship you if you hurt them?
Captain, we've got to do something!
Carolyn. What's happened to her?
Scotty, I'll find out.
How old are you?
Come over there. Well?
I don't understand.
Spurn him. Reject him. You must. You're special to him.
Yes. I love him.
Yes. Yes, I understand. He's calling me.
Lieutenant. You have your orders and your duty.
Yes, sir. My orders and my duty.
Is there a structure of some sort near you?
There is indeed, Mister Spock.
Very good. How are you doing on the force field?
Captain. I would recommend a discreet distance.
Well, it doesn't serve any other purpose I know of.
Yes, I know. I know. Scotty. We'll wait.
I am Apollo. I've chosen you.
I don't believe it. You love me.
What the devil is that?
Sensors are picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area.
Captain, we've got to go and find her!
We've got to be here when he comes back.
But what if he doesn't. What if he
Fire those phasers! That's an order, Mister Spock!
More power to the shields.
I wish we hadn't had to do this.
It's Spock. Have you noticed anything strange about him?
No, nothing in particular. Why ?
It's all right. Carry on, Miss Chapel.
Bones, I'm a busy man.
Spock, what the devil is this all about?
All right, Spock, let's have it.
Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated.
No. Nothing of that nature, Captain.
Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong?
I need rest. I'm asking you to accept that answer.
Alter course to Vulcan. Increase speed to warp four.
Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant.
Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance.
I quite understand, Captain.
How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us?
Mister Spock. Come with me, please.
Deck five. You've changed course for Vulcan, Mister Spock. Why?
Do you deny it?
No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible.
Then why'd you do it?
I'm trying to help you, Spock.
Ask me no further questions. I will not answer.
I order you to report to the Sickbay.
Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you.
I think I'm going to get space sick.
Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan.
Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain.
I don't know.
You say you're convinced he knows what it is?
No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order.
It has to do with biology.
What kind of biology?
But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're
Mister Sulu, you don't think
Let me alone. Let me alone!
Well, that's that.
Course already plotted. Laying it in, sir.
I don't understand.
Your face is wet.
My name is Christine.
Oh, I'd be very glad to do that, Mister Spock.
Is it permitted?
I shall be honoured, sir.
Captain. We're standing by on Vulcan hailing frequencies, sir.
This is Spock.
She's lovely, Mister Spock. Who is she?
She is T'Pring. My wife.
It's lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler.
The atmosphere is thinner than Earth.
The marriage party approaches. I hear them.
Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife.
He never mentioned that his family was this important.
This is Kirk.
What is it? What happened?
Think Spock can take him?
I doubt it. Not in his present condition.
No! I am to be the one. It was agreed.
I ask forgiveness.
My friend does not understand.
What happens to Spock if I decline?
You can't do it, Jim.
Jim, listen, if you
What do you mean, if both survive?
You're going to have to kill him, Jim.
McCoy to Enterprise.
I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me.
Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission immediately, of course.
So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements.
Don't you think you better check with me first?
Nurse, would you mind, please?
Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical.
Come on, Spock. Let's go mind the store.
No sign of the inhabitants so far. Kirk out.
Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden?
Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden.
Enterprise, alert! Stand by to beam up landing party.
No, Captain. I can travel.
Bones, can you save him?
On my way. Scotty. Bones?
I don't know yet, Jim.
Good. Go to Yellow Alert.
Yellow Alert. All stations go to Yellow Alert.
I can try, Captain.
Message to Starbase, sir?
Kirk to Sickbay.
So, they've broken the treaty.
Research is not the Klingon way.
Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott.
We've seen different development at rates on different planets.
Then you and I are transporting down.
I can't leave Spock at this time.
And if that's not it?
I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but
I understand. We'll arrange a rendezvous schedule. Kirk out.
Perfect. Tyree's camp's a quarter of a mile away.
Do I have a choice?
They left. Out of orbit.
Tyree. Some of his men. Cure.
Take him to the cave. I bring Tyree.
You and your Garden of Eden.
I took you because you cast a spell upon me.
The night of madness.
Oh, Tyree, did you really hate that madness?
What is it?
The stranger, where is he?
Nona, where's Kirk? The cave?
Tyree, you wish me to save him?
You mean he's conscious?
I am Tyree.
And I'm Tyree's woman.
It is Kirk. She will cure him.
A mahko root.
A plant? It moves.
Bones. I had the strangest dream.
How do you feel, Jim?
She must sleep also.
He is hers?
Yes, James! James, it's good to see you.
Good. It is past time to plan.
And of things to be done.
The readings are beginning to fluctuate.
Do whatever he says?
Have you seen any strangers among the villagers?
Many ways? What else does she know about us?
We're simply strangers from
You will not speak of this to others.
I am grateful.
A splendid custom if not carried to extremes.
No! I said I will not kill!
The guard. We must wait.
Tyree, supposing you had to fight? What then?
You are late, my friend Apella.
A way to shoot further and straighter.
Jim. Coal for forge, sulphur for gun powder.
Let's take a look inside.
Hit you? No! I can't
Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness.
Leave me alone!
Have you gone daft?
That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor.
What's this all about?
Here, let me help you, Mister Spock.
Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered.
Yes, I see you are.
Jim, I want to talk to you.
Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants?
And if the Klingons give their side even more?
Stand by to signal the captain.
You are here because I wished you here.
Oh? I thought it was my idea.
Can you smell this fragrance? Some find it pleasing.
I'd like to talk to you.
Again. Some find it soothing. Yes.
I would like
I feel dizzy. Yes, you are lovely. You're beautiful.
Where's Captain Kirk? Tyree, the firestick. Where is it?
There! I left it there.
I do not want it.
I bring you victory for Apella!
Touch me again, and this small box will kill you.
No, no. I'm all right. My phaser. She took it.
Tomorrow in the palm of her hands.
Well, you got what you wanted.
Spock, are you alive?
